## CSC 225 Assignments

* [A1](/Assignments/CSC225/A1/)
	* Checks if a file contains 3 integers that sum to 225.

* [A2](/Assignments/CSC225/A2)
	* Uses an odd type of mergesort in order to sort an integer array.
	* ChunkMergesort recursively finds already sorted chunks and merges them into a sorted array.

* [A3](/Assignments/CSC225/A3/)
	* A PQ-Heap implementation. Can sort as well.

* [A4](/Assignments/CSC225/A4/)
	* A graph generator that can read/write, find cycles, determine amount of components, return preOrder and postOrder of the graph, and check if a vertex can be reached. 
	* Uses adjacency matrix implementation.
