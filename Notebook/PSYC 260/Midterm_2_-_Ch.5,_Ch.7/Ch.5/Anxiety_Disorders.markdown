**Types of Anxiety, Trauma-Related, and OC Disorders**
**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

* DSM specifies atleast 6 months of anxiety or excessive worry
* Most people worry, but can set the problem aside. GAD patients hop from one worry to another, as soon as the challenge is completed.
* Physically, those afflicted with GAD experience muscle tension, susceptibility to fatigue, and mental irritation
* Focusing is often diffcult, the mind is usually occupied by crisis.
* **Diagnostic Criteria:**
	* Excessive anxiety and worry occuring more days than not for ateast 6 months
	* Individual finds it difficult to control the worry
	* Anxiety or worry is associated with three or more of the following (children only need one):
		* Restlessness, feeling keyed up, on edge\
		* Easily fatigued
		* Difficulty concentrating, mind going blank
		* Irritability
		* Muscle tension
		* Sleep disturbance (difficult falling/staying asleep, restless, unsatisfactory)
	* Anxiety, worry, or physical symtoms cause significant distress or impairment to social ,occupational, or other important areas
	* not due to a substance or other condition
	* the disturbance cannot be better explained by another disorder
* **HUGE:** *A distinct difference to other anxiety disorders is the patients know they worry about minor things, 100% percent say yes when asked.*
* **Statistics:**
	* In any given year, 1.1% of the canadian population experiences GAD.
	* About 2/3 of individuals with GAD are female
		* Geographical, males in South Africa are more vulnerable than woman.
	* More gradual onset, usually noticed in early adulthood
	* More common in the elderly, most common in group over 45, less common in people between 15 to 25.
* **Causes**
	* There are links to genetic contribution
		* Twin studies show that one twin had GAD, and the other experienced anxiety, but was not diagnosed.
	* Compared to panic disorders, people with GAD show much less physiological difference than normal people.
	* When compared with normies, the key distinction among the anxious group is muscle tension
	* **Cognitive Distinctions:**
		* Intolerance of uncertainty
		* Erroneous beliefs of worry
		* Poor problem orientation
		* Cognitive avoidance
* **Treatment**
	* Benzodiazepenes are most commonly prescribed, but they impair motor and cognitive function.
		* Not usually prescribed for short term illness.
	* Antidepressents seem to be a better choice for battling GAD.
	* Showing patients images that cause anxiety, instead of avoidance.
	* Teaching patients to relax deeply to combat tension
	* **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy**
	* For the long term: Psychological treatments are much better than drugs


* **Panic disorder / Agoraphobia**
	* **Panic Disorder: **An individual experience sever unexpected panic attacks.
	* **Agoraphobia: **Fear or avoidance of situations in which a person feels unsafe, or unable to escape in the event of a panic attack or physiological symptoms (diarhhea, or loss of bladder control)
	* People with a panic disorder usually contract agoraphobia due to the unexpected attacks, and the fear of public embarrasment.
	* in severe cases: people find it hard or impossible to leave the house for months, years.
	* **Clinical Description**
		* To meet the critera for a PD, the individual must experience unexpected attacks and develop substantial anxiety over time.

		* Fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger
		* Fear, anxiety, or avoidance is peristant for > 6 months
		* Fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes significant distress or impairment of life functions
		* if another condition is present, the fear, anxiety must clearly be unrelated or excessive
		* The fear, anxiety, or avoidance cannot be better explained by another condition
		* They must actually be afraid of going out due to their attacks, cant be due to a specific phobia or OCD.
	* **Statistics:**
		* Pd is fairly comon. ~3.5% of the population meet the criteria, 3/4 being women.
			* 5.3% meet the critera for agoraphobia
		* Onset usually occurs in early adult life
			* mid teens, to the 40s. Mean age is 25-29.
		* The more severe the agoraphobia, the more women seem to be affected in proportion
		* Less men report both, cause they think they must "tough it out"
		* Men generally believe alchohol is an acceptable cope for anxiety
	* **Causes:**
		* Strong evidence indicates agoraphobia follows after unexpected PDs
		* PD and attacks seem to be strongly correlated with biological and psychological factors
		* Conditioning can occur with patients.
			* Ex. Exercising may lead a person to believe they are going through an attack (increased heart rate, sweating)
		* Approximately 8-12% of the population has an occasional unexpected panic attack
		* Individuals without anxiety see their PD as reactions to a present event, such as an argument with a friend, something they ate, a bad day, etc
		* Anxiety can lead to a person feeling like they may have an impending attack, which leads to stress, which leads to a panic attack

				* 50% of people with a phobia experienced a true alarm, the other had a panic attack which leads to a learned fear
