### Somatic Symptom Disorder
Psychodynamic Therapy has been tried with little results of effectiveness
To reveal unconcious content of a client's psyche to alleviate psychic tension.
Reassurance and education appear to be effective.
People with these disorders usually dont benefit from reassurance, as it is short-term positive reinforcement. Maybe the education gives them knowledge on the "meaning" of their symptoms, where their anxiety comes from, etc.
