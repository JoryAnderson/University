		* Sensitivity to alcohol

* **Psychodynamic Perspective**
	* Childhood traumas during oral stage
		* Unconscious conflicts about dependency
	* Alcohol
		* Releases inhibitions, allow conflict expression
		* Satisfy oral gratification and need for dependancy
	* **Criticism to Psychodynamic Perspective**
		* No evidence supporting it. Has been mostly refuted
* **Personality Perspective**
	* Is there an addictive personality?
		* Certain personalities are predisposed to becoming addicted to substances.
	* Possible characterisitics:
		* Antisocial persoanlity
		* Sensation seeking
		* bevhavioural undercontrol
* **Cognitive-Behavioural perspective**
	* Learned expectations
		* Exepect a benefit from drinking = drinking more
	* Tension reduction model
		* Drinking more likely before social stressor
* **Social Learning Perspective**
	* Social influences across the lifepsan
		* Childhood:
			* Parents should have knowledge of who their child is hanging out with, or where they are
			* children who enjoy misbehaving (skipping school, not obeying parents, etc) will start drinking at a younger age, due to society's disapproval
		* Adolescence
			* A common (and inaffective) practice is for parents to encourage drinking in a safe environment (their house). This increases use of alcohol in general.
			* Teaching your child that alcohol is ONLY for special occasions seems to help as well.
			* Convey that alcohol isnt special, you dont need it to fit in or have friends.
			* The younger you start using alcohol, the more likely you will get Alcohol Use Disorder
			* Prevening binge drinking is a great way to reduce risk.
		* Adulthood
			* Those who believe there is something to benefit from drinking (feeling good, fitting in) seem to be more at risk
			* Those with the flushed face reaction are discouraged from drinking by the reaction.
* **Sociocultural Perspective**
	* Environmental risks
		* Availability of alcohol
		* Cultural norms
			* England: high consumption, high alcoholism
			* Italy: high consumption, low alcoholism
				* This may be due to drinking during dinner, it paces people. It is considered normal to drink while eating, and unusual to drink alone (without a meal)
