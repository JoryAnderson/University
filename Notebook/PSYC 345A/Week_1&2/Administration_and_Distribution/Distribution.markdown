* Drugs are molecules
	* Diffusibility and solubility
		* membrane and drug (respectively)
		* determines drug concentration
			* Body vs s.o.a
			* duration
			* elimination


#### Membrane Diffusibility

* **Cell Membrane**
	* **Stomach vs intestine**
		* Permeability to bloodstream
		* Lipid and large protein molecules
			* precursors
			* small lipid-soluable drugs
		* Problem
			* high solubility results in drug molecules aggregating outside the CNs
				* No discriminability
				* Less "potent" in CNS
				* Longer-lasting/annulled effects
	* **Capillaries**
		* Vascular system
		* tightly packed cells
			* Minimal transmission across membrane
				* molecule size/shape
			* Circulation affects molecule moement
				* Blood flows in specfic direction
	* **Blood-brain barrier**
		* Brain
		* Active diffusion
			* Function of vasculature
				* ion pump
		* Passive diffusion
			* Transport protein
			* Drug molecule
				* Small/simple chains
				* Uncharged (not an ion
	* **Placental "Barrier"**
		* Semi-permeable membrane
		* Maternal blood vessel and blood, fetus' capillaries
		* Controls for rate of exchange
			* Osmotic principles
			* 75-100% of maternal drug concentration in 5 min
			* differential effects depend on gestattional stage
