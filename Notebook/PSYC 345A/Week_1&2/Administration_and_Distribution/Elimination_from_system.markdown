# Elimination from system
Created Wednesday 10 January 2018

Dependant on...
intake method
	
Liver
Enzyme proliferation
tolerance
"First pass" metabolism
Drug concentration is reduced before reaching s.o.a
Metabolites can be more or less effective than parent
side effects
Excreted
Dependant on...
Toxicity of metabolites
High toxicity = Zero order reaction
Low toxicity = First order reaction
Half-life
time taken to eliminate half of a drug concentration from the body
Overdose results in zero order transactions


#### Drug Testing
**Urinalysis**; metabolites
**Blood sample; **drug
Problems
Detection time < Elimination time
Cannot say when it was taken
Length of drug use
Metabolic deposits
Individual differences
Rates, body mass, enzymes
Negative results don't necessarily confirm use
Probability, False positives
**Drug Testing**
Tampering
Substitution
Adulteration
Dilution
can make the drug concentration so low it's below detection threshold
Other methods
Hair analysis
Higher detection period (apprx 90 days)
Oral fluid testing
Robust to tampering
Reliant on intake method
			

### Watershed Area
 An area where two arteries meet, where blood supply is decreased (border-zone)
Internal carotid Artery
Anterior and Middle Cerebral Artery

Extremely dangerous due to clotting, changes in blood pressure, bleeding
