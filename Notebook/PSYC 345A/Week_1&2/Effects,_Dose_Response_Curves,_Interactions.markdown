### Enzymes and Effects
![](./Effects,_Dose_Response_Curves,_Interactions/pasted_image002.png)
Describe what happens...
By the enzyme
Inhibition, Induction
to drug/metabolites action
Additive, antagonism
Process:

**Enzymatic Inhibition**
![](./Effects,_Dose_Response_Curves,_Interactions/pasted_image004.png)


* Drug B blocks the enzyme
	* This is additive for the drug (more green squares remain)
		* If the drug causes the effect, then the effect is larger
	* but antagonistic to the metabolites (fewer blue/yellow are created)
		* If the metabolites cause the effect, then the effect is smaller

**Enzymatic Induction**
![](./Effects,_Dose_Response_Curves,_Interactions/pasted_image005.png)


* Drug B helps the enzyme
	* This is antagonistic for the drug (less green squares remain)
		* If the drug causes the effect, then the effect is smaller
	* but additive to the metabolites (more blue/yellow are created)
		* If the metabolites cause the effect, then the effect is larger

**What is Drug B doing?**

* Inhibition
	* Blocking
	* Decompsing or stopping its production
		* Gnerally dangerous because body still needs enzymes!
	* Induction
		* Facilitating production
		* Activating the enzyme
