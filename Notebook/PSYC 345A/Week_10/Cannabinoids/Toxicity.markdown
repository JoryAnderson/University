Confound with analgesics and methylphenidate
Delta9-THC results in unique stimulus effects
Dose-dependant effects

Learned responses
First-time users require "instruction" to experience effects
Attitudes affect positive or negative outcome
Different Cannabinoids (canabidiol) result in different effects (?)

Higher incidence of hallucination/delusions in users THC
No differences b/w non-users and users CBD + THC
