# Potency
Created Wednesday 28 March 2018

### Potency
Hashish "more potent" than Marijuana
Problem: effects are dose-dependant, but dosages vary!
2-6x more THC in Hashish than in Marijuana
Problem: Modern strains show variable and higher concentrations
2% in 1980s to 8-20% in 2000's depending on strain
Skews interpretation/comparability of research
Dose Dependant effects
Light-headed, tingling -> euphoric, exhilarated -> calm, relaxed
"buzz" < "high" < "stoned"


### Intake
Inhalation (1min - 2/4 hours)
Only 50% of the delta9-THC is released into smoke
Time held in lungs affects absorption
20% is usually absorbed
**Contact high:** second-hand inhalation can result in psychoactive levels
Little evidence that this is a possibility in casual social situations
Ingestion (1h3 - 4/6hr)
First-pass metabolism deactivates 50%
Metabolites still psychoactive, but to a lesser extent
Requires x3 more to acheie comparable high to inhalation
"gatekeeper" mechanism?
Problem: lack of immediate effects makes users eat more
Highly lipid-soluble
4-5 days of use leads to long-term pharmacological action of about 7 days
