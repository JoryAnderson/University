# Effects
Created Tuesday 03 April 2018

### Partial Agonism
Endocannabinoid system
Neurotransmitters: anadamide, 2-AG
Metabotropic Receptors
**CB:** basal ganglia, substantia nigra, cerebellum (**motor inhibition**), nucleus accumbens, VTA, hippocampus (**mood elevation, psychosis**), hippocampus (**memory**), cerebral cortex (**cognitoin, pain, relief**), thalamus, spinal hypothalamus (**appetite**)
Stimulating effect: Increased dopamine in nucleus accumbens


### Behavioural Effects of Delta9-THC
Dose Dependant
Motor coordination and reaction time
low dosage: Increase in motor activity decrease coordination
high dosage: decrease motor activity increase in reaction time
Compensatory reactions to disruptions in vigilance
Problem: methods focus on driving simulations  -> generalizability
			
"Amotivational Syndrome"
Persistent lack of motication to engage in productive activities
No evidence for the effects of cannabinoids in research focusing on reward-based strategies
Opposite was observed; cannabis made effortful tasks seem less effortful
Some suppositoin that effects are observed for self-motivated or non-reward tasks
Problem: What constitutes a reward?
Not found in cross-cultural studies


### Cognitive Effects of Delta9-THC
Dose dependant
Short-term memory impairment
Word recall
Low dosage: memory deficits with no attention impairment
High dosages: Memory, reasoning, and attention impairment
As measured by engagement "staying on task"
"Fading out", not being distracted (i.e., vigilance)
Problem: High dosage used synthetic drug
Decelerated Time
Associated with the "stoned" phase, in which the perception of time is slowed down
Reduction in blood flow to cerebellum
**Temporal disintegration:** Alteration in perception associated with time (e.g., sequence, tempo)
"flight of ideas": Spontanenous, seemingly random ideas
Subjectively reported as racing thoughts, though maybe related to vigilance and time perception deficits
Cognitive threshold impairment (?)
debate: low should cause confusion, high should cause "numbing"
						

### Long-term Effects
"Gateway" or "Stepping-stone" theory
Marijuana use will lead to illicit drug use
Popularized in the 60's and 70's
Support for process, but not for outcome
Process: Alcohol -> Marijuana -> Stim/Opioid/Halluc
Problem:
Not all users progress to the next step
Users still make use of earlier process drugs
Alternative: Correlated Vulnerabilities
Drug use is accounted for by the user's characteristics (i.e. propensity for drug use)
i.e., Users will use anything, it is not a function of a kind of drug
When compared to non-users
Verbal fluency & Divided attention
Perseverating
No differences found when comparing heavy users to former heavy users, light users, and nonusers

1. Intellectual impairment reversed with abstinence

Statistical diffferences were skewed

2. When controlling for age of onset, early onset (< 17 yoa) heavy users revealed severe verbal IQ dfeficits

40% higher chance for schizophrenia, GAD, and depression
Younger age of onset increases risk
Does not result from changes to endocannabinoid system
Changes in dopaminergic pathway
