# Placebo
Created Friday 19 January 2018

#### Placebo effect
An effect in the absense of ...treatment?
Problems with documenting/researching placebo include..
1) the operationalization of palcebo: what constitutes treatment?
Problem: Medicalization (institutionalization) of treatment
Plaecbo observed for "Substances", Suggestions, presence of a doctor
2) The operationalization of outcome
Objective measures vs Subjective measures
assessment vs self-report
physiological and psychological
"outcome"
Better, worse, neutral?
Expectancy effects
Unique to every human
Rely on individual's experiences, knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes
Can originate in the user, or from observing others
Problem: how to (experimentally) control?
**Beliefs **(i.e. "how I feel about the thing")
Problem: Measuring subjective experience
Debate: disappointment should make report wose: p's report feeling better
Solution: Objective measures (behavioural observation)
Result: skills show improvement or deteriment based on previous expressed belief
**Attention **(i.e. "preoccupation")
Problem:
Participation may distract from symptoms
Compliancy
Solution:
Explicit report should draw attention back to symptoms
Objective measures should be unaffective
Result: p's demonstrate improvement
**Ambiguity**
Physiological responses are not always clear cut
James-Lange theory of emotion
				
### Restrictions
Rates
Clinical studies that demonstrate larger effects than research studies
Alleviating sensory impairment more than Moritic impairment
Treatment of psychological disorders which show more success than physiological disorders
Magnitude
Men who show larger responses than women, except for "antidepressants"
Children who demonstrate larger effects than adults
	
### Dopamine Reward Prediction

Can explain...
Why people experience "feeling better"
DA related to reward
Why "feeling better" relates to placebo type
Expectancy (learned) to assocaite treatment with outcome
Cannot explain...
Why people dont report feeling worse after placebo treatment
should feel worse by comparison
Why placebo perists
atrophy of DA prediction should occur after continual absense of a treatment
Systematic differences in placebo

Condition dopamine response in reward circuitry (Permissive) elicits activation of dopamine pathways that are connected to other areas (PFC) responsible for specific actions that affect symptomatology
