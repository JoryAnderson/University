# Tolerance
Created Friday 19 January 2018

Desensitization to drug effects
Feeling of "high" doesn't "feel as good" (illicit)
does not alleviate symptoms (medical)
Factors
Repeated exposure
Dosage, rates
Developmental/physiological changes
biochemical reactions
Psychological state
expectancy, boredom
Drug Type
Toxicity (accrued vs eliminated)
Body
Selective tolerance: one effect is diminished, another is not
		
**Environment-dependant tolerance:**
Conditioned response
A psychological association that results in physiological "readiness" (allostasis)
Responsible for ODs in strange environments
**Sensitization:**
Increased response to drug, despite prolonged use
less drug, sooner high, last longer
Seemingly irreversible
Damage to brain tissue
**Behavioural Tolerance:**
Adjustment and compensation as a result of experience
Self-awareness
Determination


#### Cross-Tolerance
Tolerance that extends to a similar drug
**Metabolism**
Enzymes
Similar chemical structure results in deactivation
**CNS response**
Similar sight-of-action (s.o.a)
Down-regulation of receptors affect neurotransmitters of all transmitters at the receptor
Similar reward-feedback mechanism
``An`` upper limit to neurotransmitters release (DA) implies a plateau in reward-feedback
				


### Pharmacodynamic "Functional"
Physiological response
CNS; number of receptors/neurotransmitters
**Protracted**
occurs after several exposures
Cellular adaptation
reduction in number of receptors
Requires more drug to obtain similar subjective effect (graded)
Avoid withdrawal symptoms
**Acute (Tachyphylaxis)**
Occurs after only one exposure
Physiological efficiency:
related to toxicity, and similarity to endemic compounds
Reduces the subjective effecvt (threshold)
Including in cross-tolerance
Psychological effects observable during intake, but not elimination


### Pharmacokinetic "Dispositional"
Changes in metabolism as a result of constant concentrations within the body
Increase in rates of
**Enzyme-specific proliferation**
problem: Physiological "cost", and potential harm to similar substrates
**Elimination from body**
Problem: zero-order elminination induces stress
Medical issue: maintaining constant drug levels
Illicit drugs: shorter (abolished) "high" times
