# Homeostasis
Created Tuesday 23 January 2018

### Homeostasis
Equilibrium; internal stable condition
energy/resources are used most efficiently with the least "loss"
**Allostasis:** (more permanent) physiological changes that occur to obtain homeostasis to adapt to severe environmental demands
**Cellular Adaptation Theory**
adaptation is physiological or pathological
**Number of receptors change, not receptor sensitivity**
Down-regulation: avoid toxicity
Up-regulation: increase sensitivity
	
**Opponent Process Theory**
Every process is followed by a secondary opponent (opposite) process
__Two biological effects__
(Pharmacodynamic & Pharmacokinetic Tolerance)
In order to maintain homeostasis, the body *compensates* to the drug effects
__One psychological effect__
(Environmental Tolerance
Conditioning: propagation of compensatory response to drug cues
**Problems:**

1. Does not account for drug effects
	a. Doesn't differentiate b/w the elimination rates of Zero- vs. First- order reaction
	b. Cant explain tachyphylaxis
	c. Doesn't take into account drugs that don't produce withdrawal
2. Compensatory response is not a response, but a state
	a. Allostasis
		1. Implies separate mechanisms
		2. Implies physiological stress/duress
