### Dopamine: Relating Problem and Solution
**Motivation**: Depletion causes disinhibition (Motor)
evo perspective: facilitates action
Cog neuroscience perspective: induces 
**Guidance**
Surges to correct responses, resulting in organization of responses (conditioning)
After repetition, response is propagated
**Reinforcement**
Primary dopamine response to *obtaining* reward
Secdonary DA response to restored homeostasis (discomfort removed)
