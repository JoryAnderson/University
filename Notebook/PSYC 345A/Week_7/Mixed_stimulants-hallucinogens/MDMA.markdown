Enters the neuron in place of the transmitter leaving more in the synapse
Step 2a
**Leaky vesicles**
**Reverse transport: **Dose-dependent effects
Low levels: Serotonin
High levels: Serotonin and Dopamine
Effects on Dopamine weaker than those on Serotonin
Effects of Norepinephrine release i nstill in question/unclear
Step 3a
**Agonistb **at 5-HT~1~, and 5-HT~2~ receptor
Facilitated release of oxytocin
(Limbic System)
Step B

Sudden and extreme onset
Loss of unconsciousness, brain hemorrhaging, tachycardia
In conjunction with "club" condition (exertion, high temp)
Hyperthermia, dehydration -> multiple organ failure, seizures, kidney failiure, muscular breakdown and blood clot
Psychologically: Emphatogenic
increased emotional warmth/empathy, lowered defensiveness, increase in verbal behaviour
Mild euphoria due to oxytocin
Females more susceptible to effects
Sudden and extreme onset
Paranoia, panic, delirum hallucinations
Overdose is typified by impulsive irrational behaviour
Tolerance
Diminished effects after 7 uses
Serotonin receptor down-regulation and less serotonin release
effects wear off after 1 year abstinence 
Sporadic intake decreases in-between times
Some subjectrive report of MDMA and tablets getting weaker
Dependence:
Uncertain
Tolerance occurs due to physiological factors
No withdrawal behaviours
Psychological dependence has not been well documented
Confounded with poly-drug use, reports of dysthmiaa/depression pre-use
