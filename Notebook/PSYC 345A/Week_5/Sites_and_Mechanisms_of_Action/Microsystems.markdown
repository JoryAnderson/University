### Microsystems
Cells
Neurons
Anatomuc
4 structural division
Metabolic (Soma)
Input (dendrites)
Conduction (Axon)
Output (Terminals)
Functional
Communication
Integration (Hillock)
Transmission (Nodes of Ranvier)
Synapse
				
Postsynaptic Potentials
Threshold
Excitatory (EPSP) (depolarization)
Na rushes into the cell through voltage-gated channels
Inhibitory (IPSP) (repolarization)
K leaves causing hyperpolarization, Cl balances back to threshold
Decrease vs Increase polarity
Na vs Cl
All-or-none
Spatial Summation
Temporal Summation
Graded
		
Action Potential
Emergency response to depolarization
neutral neurons =dead neurons
Threshold
Propagation
Refractory period
