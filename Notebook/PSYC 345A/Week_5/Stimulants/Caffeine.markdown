Created Friday 09 February 2018

### (Methyl)xanthines
Alkaloid
Naturally found in plants and human body
subcomponent of many organic compounds
Evo. Perspective: bi-directional relationship b/w plants and humans (eat-or-be-eated)
Organic-solvent soluble, moderately water-soluble
Genrally poisonous at larger amounts
Botanical Origin
Caffeine -> theophylline, theobromine -> paraxanthine
Active metabolites
Structurally similar to Serotonin, histamine, dopamine, (glatuamate)

### Neurochemistry
**Neuromodulator:	**A chemical used by neuron to communicate to other neurons about their function (not to activate them)
Regulare gene expression & set-points
Adenosine
Inhibitory effect
Sleep/arousal
Striatum
Glutamate Antagonist
Cognition, Memory/Learning
hippocampus
Dopamine Antagonist
Everywhere else

### Adenosine antagonist
Adenosine (A~1~) receptor associated with...
Slowing metabolic function
Retrograde messenger
Postsynaptic depression of NMDA* receptor
NMDA -> memory, synaptic plasticity (hebbian learning)
Caffeine facilitates memory and synaptic plasticity... TO A POINT!
Hyper activcation results in inability to focus
"jitters"
Constrict vasculator in brain
Migraine
Caffeine is a migraine remedy, a migraine comes from a lack of blood flow in the brain's vasculator
A~1~ and A~2~ responsible for...
Oxygen in blood flow
Reducing heart rate
caffeine and theophylline used to avoid hypoxia (stimulate respiration)
New research
Opening the blood-brain barrier
caffeine would thus limit permeability
A~3~ can be used to inhibit melanoma cells
Caffeine would thus interfere
A~2a~ Anti-inflammatory agent
Caffeine would thus allow inflammation, however it also directly promotes inflammation reduction
