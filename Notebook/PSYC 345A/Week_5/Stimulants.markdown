# Stimulants
Created Friday 09 February 2018

**Operationalization: drug effects**
**Biological (medical)**
A substance that raises levels of physiological or nervous activity in the body
Objective - can be quantified byu counts/limits
Paradoxical: suppressant enhances inhibition
**Sympathomimetic**
Mimic/simulate activity of the sympathetic nervous system

1. Physiological arousal of "fight or flight"
	a. Alertness, arousal -> positive mood
2. Parasympathetic suppression
	a. Anorectic effects (appetite suppression)

**Behavioural (Physchological)**
chemicals that induce temporary improvements in mental/physical function
Subjective; detemined by ranges, comparisons (to baseline)
"Improvement" is dependant on functionality of behaviour
Alertness vs Anxious
Ambiguity in attribution may allow for different interpretation
**James-Lange theory of emotion**
Happy vs Panic


### Stimulant characteristics
**State-dependant memory**
Memory retrieval is more fficient under similar conditions to memory encoding
Debate: encoding, consolidation, retrieval, or all?
Formation neuronal pathway is aversively affected
Consolidative mechanisms do not show selectivity due to hyperacvtivation
Failure in retrieval
**Speed/Accuracy trade off**
Learned behaviours not for new behaviours
lack of practice effects
