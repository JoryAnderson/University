# Psilocybin
Created Wednesday 14 March 2018

**Street Name:** Mushrooms, "shrooms"

Psilocybin mushrooms (~200 species)
Pre-drug or pre-cursor to the active ingredient "Psilocin"
Lipid-soluble indole similar to LSD (**tryp**tamine)
		
Intake: Ingestion
Injection reduces "high" time by half
Metabolites are effective, not the chemical
first-pass metabolism
Qualitative differences in drug effects
**Low **(4-5mg): social, warm, and "down-to-earth" feelings (less confusion, more grounded with self)
**High** (15mg+): Resemble LSD, but extremely prone to "bad trips"
Problem: all highs ~2-5 hours despite dose
*Set and setting: *"tone" or valence of trip related to, and based on pleasantness/aversiveness of environment
	
### Effects
Similar to LSD, but less intense
Serotonin (5-HT~2a~)
Effects: distort time perceptiom, timing, and rhythym
Subjective feeling of "slowing down"
Time passing slower
Inability to coordinate with any tempo above 2-2.5 seconds
Prefrontal Cortex
At low doses, increase in sense of humor
Insula(?)
Dopamine (?)
Basal Ganglia
Speculation: This might involve timed performance
Problem: No affinity for the D~2~ receptor
May relate to "permissive" hypothesis
Speculation: Responsible for relaxed feelings at low doses
			
### Tolerance
Acute
4-7 days to dissipate
More than once a week results in diminshed effects
Cross-tolerance
LSD and phenethylamines
Potentiation
MAO inhibitors prolong the "high"
Potential "complication" for MDD
No observable dependence
Indirect Effect
Death as a result of mushroom misidentification


### Therapeutic Uses
Reduction of 5-HT~2a~ receptors
Alleviation of OCD symptoms
Anxiolytics
Reduction even at high doeses
Implies biochemical not emotional effect
"Good Friday Experiment"
Increase mystical/spiritual meaning, positive changes in attitude/behaviour
		
Effects can be seen for weeks/months after treatment
Higher effectiveness, lower chances of toxicity, no known side-effects
Evidence for similar effects with LSD, except for diminished likelihood for bad trips.
