Created Tuesday 13 March 2018

### Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)
Alkaloid
Ergoline (fungus)
Toxic
Reduce bleeding/increase contractoins
Synthesiszed (1943) LSD-25
indole (nucleus)
Similar to serotonin
Street name: "Acid"
Volatile
Extremely water-soluble
Oxidation
Photosensitivity
Powder "pellets", gelatin "chips", "blotters"
Highly Potent
1 dose ("hit") = 50 - 150 micrograms
For comparison: 1 aspirin tablet = 325,000
Sympathomimetic symptoms
Increase blood pressure, temperature


### Process
Onset
30 min; no physiological effects, but sensation of relaxing or "release of tension"
Sympathomimetic response
Plateau
30min - 2hours; four different effects
1) "Images" with eyes closed
2) Synaethesia
3) Perception of "multilevel reality"
4) Distorted (exaggerated/strange) visual input
Visual cortex / Locus Coeruleus

Peak
3-5hours
1) Emotion/panic swings
2) Feelings of timelessness
3) Disembodiment or "ego-disintegration"
Prefrontal cortex
		
### Effects
Agonism
Visual cortex (Serotonin 1a, 2a)
Decrease activity in occipital lobe
Disruption in model object completion
Metabotropic receptors
Serotonin
Inhibit other serotonin receptors, excite 2A receptor on Glutamate and GABA
1: Increase sensory signals (threshold)
2: Decrease "spontaneous" signals (noise)
Refinement and Salience of signals
Induce glutamate release in cerebral cortex
Explains why perception is altered (illusions)
Interaction b/w Dopamine and Serotonin explains psychotic actions (i.e. when things get scary)
James-Lange theory
					
### Abuse Potential
Tolerance
Acute (tachyphylaxis)
3 days - 1 week to subside
Potentially dangerous as it facilitates taking more
Toxicity, emotional/perceptual effects
Cross-tolerance
Tryptamine family (shrooms, dmt)

Dependence
No physical dependence (no withdrawal)
Potential psychological dependence
"Not an easy high"
8 hour "trips" ; physically/psychologically exhausting
Alternating b/w pleasant and terrifying (not as rewarding, unpredictable)
"trip" controls the user
			
### Toxicity
**Physiological effects**
Myadrasis
Chronic pupil dilation
**Psychological Effects**
Serotonin Syndrome
The accumulation of excess serotonin in the CNS
Symptoms:
Cognitive: Hypomania, confusion, hallucinations
Autonomic: Sweating, hyperthermia, vasoconstriction, tachycardia
Somatic: Tremor, Myoclonus (twitchiness)
Lasting "Panic reactions"
Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD)
Re-experiencing symptoms from the trip when sober
Chronic (mostly visual) or episodic (all sensory modality)
Before going to sleep, in darkness, driving (stress)


### Long-Term Effects
National Survey of Drug Use (USA)
Used one of either, LSD, Mescaline, or Psilocybin at any point in their lives
Results: No difference in rates OR onset of the 11 indicators of mental-health problems when compared to controls
"Psychedelics are psychologically intense, many people will blame anything that happens for the rest of their lives on a psychodelic experience"
Problem: Correlation not causation
Problem: HPPD
HPPD-like syndrome has been found in non-drug users
"We are not claiming that no indivuduals have ever been harmed by psychedelics. Anecdotes about acid casualties can be very powerful - but this instances are rare"
