Created Wednesday 14 March 2018

Dimethyltryptamine (DMT)
Street Name: DMT, "businessman's LSD"
15m onset, 1h duration

Alkaloid found in tree bard (mimosa hostilis)
Tryptamine Family (tryptophan)
Structurally simimlar to Serotonin (indole)
Implies similar transport and ezymatic functions
Important to understand how to facilitate or suppress activation
Functionally similar to Psylocibin
Implies similar mechanism of action (s.o.a)
Important to understand it's effects
**Structure-activity relationship:** relationship b/w a chemical's structure and biological activity
Modification (of structure) allows for changes in effectiveness or potency
			
Debate: Maybe endemic to human body/function
1) Present in other mammals
rat and rhesus monkey pineal gland
2) Tryptamines are naturally synthesized into Serotonin 
Enzyme resposnsible for DMT synthesis is founf in humans, but...
Not in the brain (only in the body)
mRNA for enzyme has not been found in brain
Debate: Potential immune (stress) reposnse signal?
Speculation: pineal gland and near-death experience
3) Synthesis in (cancerous) human cells observed in laboratory settings
Greatly susceptible to enzymatic metabolism
4) Faciliation of immune response on endemic receptors
Problem: Treatment does not imply endemic origin

### Intake
Inhalation, Injection
Virola, "snuff"
	
Ingestion
problem: MAO (enzyme) deactivates/breaks down dMt molecule in Liver
Solution: provide MAO inhibitor (MAO-I)
**Ayahausca: **brew which includes plant-derives DMT, and harmine/ harmaline /  tetrahydroharmine (MAO-I)
Results in:
Longer "highs" of 3-6 hours
Similar experience to psilocybin but more intense (lesser than LSD, but may include synaesthesia)
"la purga": intense vomiting/diarrhea
No dietary restrictions (only acts on MAO-A)
						
### Abuse Potential
Tolerance
Acute or None?
Debated: 1 dose rapid onset 1 hour off set
Cycle of "high" may interfere with perception of tolerance
Short duration may not faciliate tolerance
Cross-tolerance
No cross-tolerance to LSD
LSD cross-tolerance with DMT
Dependance
No observable physical
Psychological still in question
Ayahausca predentds negative side-effects and religious connotation : no addiction potential

### Therapeutic Use
DMT therapeutic uses
**Hoasca Project**
Scales of depression, anxiety, alcohol consumption, ADHD symptoms, etc
Adolesences had 7x lower incidence of anxiety, body dysnorphism, and attention problems
**Insight-oriented Psychotherapy**
Behavioural/cognitive restructuring
PTSD, phobia, anxiety
"Rationalization": cognitive restructuring based on logic
Removing/changing the emotional component
Depression, addiction
Therapeutic "insight"
Feears, beliefs, motives, desires
		
Frontal Love
DMT elicits/brings forth traumatic experience
Elicits multiplicity of perspectives/perceptions
Hyperactivation allows for Hebbian synapse to form
New/learned interpretation generally positive
