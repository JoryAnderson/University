Agonist
Debate: Serotonin or Norepinephrine?
**Serotonin (5-HT**~2a)~
"Hallucinations" (illusions/distortions) [behavioural]
1) Visual: Distinctive "kaleidoscope" imagery, fractals, "animated stained-glass"; Cubism
2) Audtiroy: Synaetsthesia
Problem: qualitatively different experience than LSD or DMT
**Norepinephrine** release in Locus Coeruleus [biological]
Leads to further glutamate relases in cerebral cortex
Hallucinations that are altered perceptions (illusions)
		
Two-fold or step-wise effect?
Serotonin induces release in of NE in LC, or facilitates glutamate response?
Euphoria observed in small doses, hallucinations in larger
Similar debate to dopamine effect
