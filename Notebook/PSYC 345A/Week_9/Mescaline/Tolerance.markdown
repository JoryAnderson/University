# Tolerance
Created Friday 23 March 2018

### Tolerance
Accrues with repeated use (across 3-6 days)
But only to hallucinogenic properties
Implies no tolerance to Dopamine (!)
Dissipates after a few days
Cross-tolerance with LSD and psilocybin

### Dependence
No physical dependence
Despite accrued tolerance (!)
Psychological dependence
(uncommon) long-term symptoms of anxiety and panic manifest
Despite negative sympathetic response
No observable dependence to Peyote
	
Debate: Potentiation of early/manifested onset of psychosis or mental illness?
Differential susceptibility or soothing?
