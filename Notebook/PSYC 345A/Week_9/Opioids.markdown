Subcategory

![](./Opioids/pasted_image.png)
Exhibit euphoric (stimulant) and anxiolytic (depressant) effects, used as a medicine (anti-psychotic)


### Agonism
Endogenous Neuropeptides
(Proopiummelancortin, proenkephalin, prodynorphin)
**cleavage:** Separating the molecule into separate chains
Internal enzymatic action
Enzyme CYP2DP6 converts codeine to morphine
Active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide
**G-protein** Metabotropic receptors
Returns neurons to resting potential sooner by allowing K+ to influx inwards

Agonistic Mechanism
1) GABA receptor mechanism
Ventral Tegmental area
Suppression of the inhibotry reponse of dopamine receptors
Nucleus Accuumbens
Actiation of m opioid receptors that inhibit GABA neurons
Allows dopamine to be released in VTA, and "enhancement: of the dopaminergic response
2_ Nociception: Sensory pathways related to pain perception
A & C fibers: sensory pain signal from receptor to spinal cord
Inhibition of neurotransmission
Glutamate and substance P: sensory pain signal from spinal chord to thalamus
Activation of medulla inhibits neurotransmissions to thalamus
"Dulling/blunting" of ``pain``
