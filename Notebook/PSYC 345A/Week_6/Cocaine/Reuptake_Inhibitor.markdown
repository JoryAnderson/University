# Reuptake Inhibitor
Created Wednesday 21 February 2018

**Reuptake Inhibitor**
**Mesolimbic Dopamine Pathway**
Blocks transporter protein
resulting in Post-synaptic reactivation
Feelings of pleasure, Acute doses: positive symptoms of Schizophrenia
**Problem**:
Limbic implies emotion

a. Dopamine is rewarding (motivating), but is difficult to disentangle from emotions
b. Euphoria is induced by acute doses, implying a different (emotional) mechanism
	1. Serotonin/Endocannabinoid mediated?

**Problem**:
Dopamine Transporter antagonists do not induce the same behavioural effects as cocaine
Debate:
Cocaine has other effects unaccounted for
Blocking or altering transporter protein
Sensitization is observed, with larger euphoria and crashes in heavy users (?) and more brain excitation
Tolerance mechanisms defunct?
