Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
Developmental Neuropsychiatric disorder

1. Impairment of growth/development
	a. Childhood onset

- Adult onset not documented, confound with substance use

2. Temporal Contiguity

- Start and consequence

3. Neurological abnormality resulting in impaired ability to function

- Anatomically based
- Differentiate from emotional/cognitive disruption (i.e. "acting out", frustration, OCD)


### 3 Subtypes
ADHD predominantly inattentive ("ADD")
Distracted, disorganized, forgetful, poor concentration, daydreaming
Executive function, memory, attention -> inattention
**Vigilant concentration**
	
ADHD predominantly hyperactive/impulsive
Fidgety/restlessness, hyperactivity, difficulty waiting, and remaining seated, immature behaviours*
Motor & behavioural inhibition
**Cognitive alertness**
			
ADHD combined - combination of former two
- Most common type
		
**Pay attention: **Hyperactivity refers to brain fucntion, not behavioural description!
		
#### Vigilant Concentration
"Staying on task"
Monitoring rules (changing the rules), updating the system, response execution
Reticular activation system; Locus Coeruleus + Basal forebrain
Norepinephrine
Continuous excessive mental work-loads
Less NT = less perseverance
Lack of "reward dependence" (sensitivity to rewards)


#### Cognitive Alertness
Orienting ("noticing")
Detection: Monitoring, reaction
Sensory awareness
Inability to ignore stimuli (lack of inhibition)
Mesolimbic/mesocortical pathway
Dopamine
Motivational significance to stimuli associated with reward
Set a value on rewards


#### Hyperfocus
"Intensive concentration on interesting and non-routine activities accompanied by temporarily diminished perception of the environment"
Facet of adult ADHD
"cannot understand how time passes" "hypnotic spell"
"aware of things they ignore but cannot give up what they're doing"
Prefrontal actiation in word fluency
(depleted) Serotonin
Associated w/ mood and conduct disorders, OCD
