#### Common Denominator Monoamines
Serotonin (anxiety, obsession)
norepinephrine (alertness, attention, enjoyment)
dopamine (motivation, reward)
"Permissive hypothesis": low serotonin causes low norepinephrine
Dopamine has to compensate by providing more precursor
Problems
Intake is immediate, behaviour change is delayed
General monoamine depletion doesn't result in depression
		

#### Best accounted for by the diathesis-stress model
Diathesis: differences in serotonin/dopamine genes and or shematics (engrained world views)
- Longitudional studies demonstrate and emergence of depression in typical -cohort who have experienced very stressful life events based on genetics
-Family studies demonstrate heritability of depression :30-40%
- Schemas have been shown to emerge prior to, and dissipate during remission in -response to stress
- Organic stress, such as withdeawal, lack of sunlight, (SADs) postpartum hormone, or drug abuse is knwon to induce depression-like symptoms
	

#### First-generation
Monoamine Oxidase inhibitors
Inhibit enzyme which breaks down monoamines at synapse (i.e inhibit the inhibitor)
Problem: "cheese reaction" - stops tyramine break-down in liver -> tyramine elevates blood pressure -> results in stroke
Hard to give up on alcohol and pizza
Irreversible vs reversible (anxiety component)
Trycyclics
Block reuptake of serotonin and norepinehprine at synapse
Problem: produce irregular or elevated hear-rate


#### Second generation
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)
Block reuptake of serotonin but NOT repeniphrine
Reduced the cardiologic side-effects
Prozac: not discovered, was designed
			

#### Third Generation
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)
Block reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine in brain
	
Debate: Are antidepressants effective?
Second/third gen. medication actively altered for depression use
Previous anti-depressants "discovered" when treating other disorders -> secondary effects
"good" vs "good enough": Do we truly understand the mechanism?
Placebo vs Second Generation
publication bias - negative results found 50% of the time, however never promoted beyond FDA
(Kirsch et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2008)
Suicidal ideation and Motivation
"Black-box" suicide warnings introduced in 2003 caused a decrease in prescription to children/teens; adolescence more likely to commit suicide off medication
