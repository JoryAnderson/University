**Cognition - **"The faculty of knowing"
**Cognitive Processes - **The set of processess that allow humans and many other animals to perceive external stimuli, extract key information, hold it in memory, and generate thoughts and actions.
**Behaviourism - **Psychologists who reject subjective work on mental functions, and regarded them as outside the domain of proper scientific inquiry.
**Operant Conditioning - **Opposes classical conditioning. The prospect of a reward will cause the animal to repeatedly engage in a behaviour that occured before receiving the reward.
**Cognitive Models - **Predicts how stimulatory input leads to some behavoioural output.
**Psychological Constructs - **Are created to explain diverse, complex phenomena without reference to their ultimate causes in the brain.
**Phrenology - **Based on Franz Gall's hypothesis of bone structure of the skull being used to measure brain function. **Phrenologists **would map the brains of different people, and constructed detailed maps that assigned functions and traits (Outdated)
**Localization of Function -** The idea that pieces of the brain process different kinds of information
**Action potentials - **Signals from neurons are sent long-distance by action potentials. **Page 7.**
**Cognitive Neuroscience - **The intersection between *Cognitive Science * and *Neuroscience*. 
**Neural Correlates **- The mapping of brains regions that are active during a psychological process.
**Individual Differences** - The ways people differ in cognitive abilities
**Convergence - **Describes the approach of combining results from multiple experimental paradigms to illuminate a single theoretical concept.
Behaviourist research is considered "too sterile" for this reason.
**Complimentarity - **How the results of one reserch method can compliment the results of another.

### Summary

* Cognitive Science seeks to understand the infomration processing associated with functions like perception, memory and decision making.
* Neuroscience seeks to characterize the structure and function of the nervous system
* Cognitive Neuroscience is a new discipline that applies research methods from neuroscience to the functions and behaviours studied by cognitive science
* Cognitive Neuroscientists use diverse research methods experimental paradigms to develop models of mental function and behaviour.
