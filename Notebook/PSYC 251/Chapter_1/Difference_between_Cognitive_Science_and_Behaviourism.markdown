# Difference between Cognitive Science and Behaviourism
Created Sunday 08 January 2017

### Behaviourists
Tried to explain behaviour using only stimuli and responses, avoiding any reference to underlying mental processes.
Did not deny the existence of mental processes, simply ignored them.

### Cognitive Science
Looks at what is going on inbetween the stimuli and response.
Focuses on information processing with cognitive functions
Cognitive Science envelops multiple disciplines
Cognitive psychology
Social psychology
Psychiatry
Neurobiology
Linguistics
Philosophy
etc
