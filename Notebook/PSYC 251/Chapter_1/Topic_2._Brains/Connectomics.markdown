# Connectomics
Created Monday 30 January 2017

The study of connectomes

### Connectome

* The "wiring diagram" of the brain


### • Diffusion Tensor/Spectrum Imaging (DTI/DSI)

* Uses MRI to measure diffusion of molecules in brain


### • Tractography

* Uses DTI/DSI data to trace out connection in brain


• DTI/DSI
---------

* Measures the strength and direction of diffusion (and therefore can be represented as vectors)
* Water molecules diffuse over time
* In neurons, diffusion tends to occur along the length of axons and dendrites
