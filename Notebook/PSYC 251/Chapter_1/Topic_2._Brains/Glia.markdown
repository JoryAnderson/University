# • Glia

* Created Monday 16 January 2017



* Glia = Neuroglia = Glial cells



* "Glia" comes from the Greek for "glue"
* Non-neuronal cells in the nervous system
* Function include:
	* Support neurons physically
	* Supply neurons with nutrients and oxygen
	* Insulate neurons from each other
	* Protect neurons from pathogens and clean out dead neurons
	* Modulate/regulate neural activity
* ~100 billion glial cells (1/2 of CNS volume)

#### • Astrocytes (CNS) & Satellite Cells (PNS)

* Structural support for neurons
* Help create the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
* Provides nutrients to neurons
* Modulate neural activity through reuptake of neurotransmitters and regulation of ion concentration

#### • Oligodendrocytes (CNS) & Schwann Cells (PNS)

* Warp axons in myelin to insulate them and speed conduction of APs

#### • Ependymal Cells (CNS)

* Help produce and circulate cerebrospinal fluid

#### • Microglia (CNS)

* Macrophages that devour and digest celluar debris (phagocytosis)
