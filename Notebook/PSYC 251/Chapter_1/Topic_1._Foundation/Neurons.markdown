* **What are Neurons?**
	* Specialized biological cells
	* In the CNS and PNS.
	* Primary Function is information processing (i.e computation) and transmittal

* Input: Dendrites
* Output: Axons

	

* Axon Hillock: Where the axon connects to the cell body.
* Nodes of Ranvier: The space between the myelin sheaths

### • Types of Connections Between Synapses:

* **Type 1 (Axosomatic Synpase)**
	* Axons are connected directly to the cell body.
* **Type 2 (Axodendritic Synapses)**
	* Axons are connected to a dentrite, either to a spine (protruding synapse) or a synapse on the dendritic wall
* **Type 3 (Axo-axonic Synapse)**
	* Axons are connected to the synapse at the end of the axon.

### Brainbow Basics:
A single brainbow transgene expresses red, cyan or yellow.
with multiple brainbow transgenes more colors can be expressed
