# Synaptic Integration
Created Monday 16 January 2017

### Facts about synapses
Calcium ions facilitate release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic neuron
the synaptic cleft is the gap between the pre- and post-synaptic neurons
A synaptic vesicle is a membrane covered organelle that holds neurotransmitters
Sodium ions flow into postsynaptic neurons through ACh receptors
Acetylecholine is a neurotransmitter
During a postsynaptic potential, ionotropic receptors start in one or two milliseconds, and last tens of milliseconds. Metabotropic receptors start in hundreds of milliseconds, last seconds.

A PSP (postsynaptic potential)  travels from the synapse to the axon hillock (trigger zone) by electronic conduction
**Electrotonic Conduction**
Passive
Relatively fast
Exponentially attenuating
Travel short distances
**Strength of a PSP can depend on**
Strength
Timecourse
Distance to the synaose
Time since action potential

### Summary of PSPs
Triggerzone starts at the resting membrane potential
PSPs then summate
Excitatory Post Synaptic Potential (EPSPs) add to the membrane potential
Inhibitory Post Synaptic Potential IPSPs substract
An action potential fires if the sum exceeds the threshold potential


### Spatial Summation
PSPs from different synapses sum together


### Temporal Summation
PSPs from the same synapse (different points in time) sum together
