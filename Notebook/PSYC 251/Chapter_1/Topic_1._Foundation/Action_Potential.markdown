# Action Potential
Created Monday 09 January 2017

### Facts about Action Potentials
Unlike subthreshold change in membrane potential, an AP can propagate down an axon with no change in amplitude
An AP is usually an all or none phenomenon with approx. the same amplitude and duration every time in a given neuron
The initiation of an AP depends on the opening of voltage-gated ion channels
When an AP travels down a myelinated axon, it is only generated at the Nodes of Ranvier, not under the myelin sheath
The opening of Voltage-gated sodium channels causes an AP. The sodium ions cause the resting potential to meet the threshold potential.
APs only travel in one direction, due to their refractory period.

**Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs)**
When volts decrease in neuron, IPSPS increase volts to resting potential.
**Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs)**
When volts increase in neuron or Action Potential fires, decreases volts to resting potential.

### Voltage-Gated Ion Channels
**Voltage gated Sodium channel:**
A sodium ion is let through, an inactivation gate swings shut afterwards and closes it, entering a refactory period.
**Voltage-gated Potassium channel:**
If the inside of the neuron has a high enough membrane potential, it will open and let Potassium out.


### Action potential events:

1. At threshold, voltage-gated Sodium channels open, and positive Sodium ions flow into cell
2. As depolarization continues, even more voltage-gated Sodium channels open, increasing depolarization
3. Voltage-gated Potassium channels open, and Poassium ions flow out of cell.
4. Voltage-gated Sodium channels close, but voltage-gated potassium channels are still open. During hyperpolarization, another AP cannot be generate (**absolute refactory period)**
5. Voltage-gated Potassium channels close when hyperpolarized (below resting potential), membrane potential returns to steady state at resting potential (**relative refactory period**)


### Propagation of Action Potential
The action potential travels in one direction, the refractory period creates this as the signal travels down the axon.
