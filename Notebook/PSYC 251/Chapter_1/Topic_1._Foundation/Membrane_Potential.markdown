# â€¢ Membrane Potential

* Created Monday 09 January 2017



* The neuron has a Lipid bilayer
* This precents flow of ions, proteins and other water-soluble molecules
* [Membrane Potential](#Chapter 1:Topic 1. Foundation:Membrane Potential)![](./Membrane_Potential/pasted_image.png)
* A nerve cell (cytoplasmic side) will have more negative ions than the extracellular side.
* Using a voltage amplifier and oscilloscope, we can measure the potential inside the cell.

### Nongated Ion Channels
**Potassium Channel**
Outside the cell there is a higher electrical potential (electrical gradient) than inside the cell.
**Due to this, there is a higher diffusional force for sodium ions from outside to inside the cell. (electrical gradient)**
Inside the cell, there is a higher potassium concentration (concentration gradient) than outside the cell.
**Due to this, there is a higher diffusional force for potassium ions from inside to outside the cell. (concentration **
In both ways, the electricity and concentration want to balance out on either side, but since these forces oppose each other, they can balance.
Called **Electrochemical Balance**
Potassium channels allows passage both in/out.
**Nernst Equation:** Helps find balance of membrane potential between inside/outside of cell.

**Sodium Channel:**
Channels sodium out, otherwise the same as potassium channe;/
**Sodium/Potassium Pump:**
For 1 molecule of ATP (adenosine triphosphate):
2 potassium go in
3 Sodium come out.
The result is:
**Concentration Gradient:**
More sodium outside
More Potassium inside.
**Electrical Gradient:**
Higher potential outside.
