# Pt. 1 Perception
Created Tuesday 31 January 2017

#### What is perception?
Experiences resulting from stimulation of the senses
The set of processes by which we recognize, organize, and make sense of the sensations we receive from environmental stimuli
What we sense (in our sensory organs) is **not the same** as what we perceive (in our minds)
	
the **Inverse Problem:** 
Creating a stimulus (perception) of what we see in the world (distal stimulus) and what we sense (proximal sense)
		

#### Sources of Information
Genes:
Information learned on timescale of evolution
Past Experience:
Information leanred on timescale of a human life
Internal State:
Information learned on timescale of current episode
Environmental Context:
Information learned now
Proximal Stimulus
The stimulus itself
		

Sensory Systems
---------------
Vision (Visual)
Somato-sensation (Touch)
Auditory (Audio)
	
*Distal Stimulus*
An object or process out in the world
*Proximal Stimulus*
The energy or matter that effects the sensory receptors
*Neural Pathway*
From sensory receptors via thalamic nuclei to cerebral cortex
Hierarchy of Cortical Areas
Attempt to construct useful representation of distal stimulus
Percept
Mental representation of the distal stimulus
		
**Primary Visual Pathway:**
**Visual fields:**
Both visual fields on both retinas
Partial crossover at optic chiasm
Left visual field in right V1 (of Primary Visual cortex)
Right visual field in left V1 (of Primary Visual cortex)
(V4 is especially important for color vision)
(MT (Middle Temporal) & MST (Middle Superior Temporal) especially important for motor perception)
			
**Pathway:**
Ganglion Cells
Lateral Geniculate Nuclei (LGN)
Primary Visual Cortex

Auditory System
---------------
**Ear:**
Sound = Changes in air pressure
Ear Drum (Tympanum) converts changes in air pressure into mechanical vibrations
Vibrations travel through bones of middle ear (ossicles) to oval window of cochlea
Hair cells in cochlea detect vibration
		
Location of maximal excitation depends on sound frequency

**Hair Cells:**

**Primary Auditory Pathway**
Auditory nerve
Cochlear nuclei (medulla)
Superior Olivary Complex (pons)
Nucleus of lateral lemniscus (pons)
Inferior colliculus (midbrain)
Medial geniculate nucleus (thalamus)
Primary auditory cortex


Somatosensory System
--------------------
**Mechanoreception**
Detects pressure, vibration, and distortion
![](./Pt._1_Perception/pasted_image003.png)
	
**Thermoception**
Detects hot and cold
**Nocioception**
Detects harmful chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimuli
**Proprioception**
Detects mechanical forces on muscles, tendons, and joints
	
**Primary Somatosensory Pathway:**
Dorsal Root Ganglion
Gracile/Cuneate Nuclei (medulla)
Ventral Posterior nuclei (thalamus)
Primary somatosensory cortex


#### Relays
Each system uses certain nuclei in order to relay information to their respective cortexes. 
The somatosensory system uses the "Ventral posterior nucleus"
The visual System uses the "Lateral Geniculate Nucleus"
The Auditory System uses the "Medial Geniculate Nucleus"


Sensory Adaptation
------------------
The proximal stimulus is represented on a **relative scale**, not absolute
The influence of context on perception begins very early in sensory pathways


#### Visual Adaption
The sensitivity of the visual system to a light stimulus depends on the ambient light level


#### Weber's Law
The "just noticable difference" (JND) is the smallest detectable change in a stimulus
Proportionate to the magnitude of a stimulus (Delta I / I)


Receptive Fields
----------------
Area of Sensory surface to which a neuron responds
Perceptual resolution and acuity are inversely related to sensory receptive field size
Higher-order neurons have larger receptive fields
Higher-order neurons respond to more complex sensory stimuli.
