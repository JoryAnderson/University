# Pt. 2 - Sensory & Perception
Created Monday 30 January 2017

### Topographic Maps
Spatial organization (topography) of sensory surface is generally preserved in the visual and somatosensory cortices.
**Cortical Magnification:** Area of cortex is proportional to density of sensory receptors.
**Retinotopic Map: **Map of the retina
**Tonotopic Map: **Map of the ear
**Somatotopic Map:** Map of the body


### Plasticity
Changes in neural organization
Occurs from the molecular to systems level
Synaptic plasticity
Changes in the strength of synapses
Cortical reorganization
Changes in topographic maps


### Hierarchical Organization
Moving from lower-order sensory neurons to higher-order sensory neuroms
Receptive fields get larger
Sensory features get more complex (& abstract)
Sensory features get more specific
Processing is sequential, simultaneous and loops
Multi-sensory integration increases


#### Hierarchy in visual System
Primary visual cortex = striate cortex = V1
Secondary visual cortex = extrastriate cortex = V2, V3, V4, V5/MT
Tertiary visual cortex = visual association cortex = MST, LIP< etc
Multimodal association cortex = VIP, etc


### Cortical Columns
Organization of orientation feature detectors in V1
For each location in visual field for each eye, detectors in all orientations
Organized by eye (ocular dominance columns) and by columns (orientation columns)

#### Hierarchy in Auditory System
Primary auditory cortex = A1 = Core
Secondary auditory cortex = A2 = Belt
higher-order processing
Tertiary Auditory cortex = auditory association cortex = Parabelt (PB)
Multimodal Association Cortex = T2/T3, PP, etc

#### Hierarchy in Somatosensory System
Primary somatosensory cotex = S1= Ba 1,2 & 3
Secondary Somatosensory Cortex = S2 = PV
Tertiary Somatosensory cortex  = Somatosensory Association cortex = BA 5, MIP, AIP, etc
Multimodal Association Cortex = VIP, etc

### What and Where Streams

#### Visual
Higher-order sensory processing is generally divided into "what" and "where" streams
**Where (Dorsal)** stream:
Dorsal pathway: occipital lobe into parietal lobe
Emphasis on location and motion
Processing for action
![](./Pt._2_-_Sensory_&_Perception/pasted_image004.png)
Intraparietal Sulcus (IP)
Anterior (AIP)
Represents space for hand movements
Medial (MIP)
Represents space for arm movements
Lateral (LIP)
Represents space foe eye movements
Ventral (VIP)
Represents space for facial movements
**What (Ventral) **stream:
Ventral pathway: Occipital lobe into temporal lobe
Emphasis on shape and color
Processing for object recognition

Bottom-Up and Top-Down influences
---------------------------------
**Bottom-Up**
Stimulus driven
Feedforward connections
Depends on proximal stimulus and genetic influences of sensory systems
![](./Pt._2_-_Sensory_&_Perception/pasted_image006.png)
**Top-Down**
Driven by goals and expectations
Feedback connections
Depends on past experience, internal state, environmental context

(it's the same blob throughout, its identity is assumed based on context)
**Likelihood Principle: **We percieve the world in a way that is "most likely" based on our past experience

**Interactive Activation theory: McClelland and Rumelhart**
Model of letter & word perception
Integrates bottom-up and top-down processes
