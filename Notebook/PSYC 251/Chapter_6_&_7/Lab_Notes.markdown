• Brodmann's Areas associated with Attention
--------------------------------------------

* The Brodmann Area closely associated to the Temporal Parietal Junction and Inferior Parietal Loule is BA 40
* The Brodmann Area closely associated to the ventral frontal cortex and Inferior frontal gyrus is BA 44
* The Brodmann Area closely associated the Intraparietal Sulcus and Superior Parietal Lobule is BA 7


• Visual Search
---------------

* Searching for a red square among red triangles and blue squares requires a conjunction search.
	* Each element in a conjunction search increases search time on average by 50ms



* Single feature search must be done for all elements in parallel (at same time), whereas conjunction search must be done for each element serially (one at a time)



* According to Treisman's feature integration theory, the slope is twice as steep when the target is absent because:
	* When the target is present, the average amount of elements searched is half, whereas when the target is present, all elements are searched before the target is declared absent
