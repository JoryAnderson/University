### • Feature Integration Theory (Treisman, 1986, 1998)

* Feature Search:
	* Individual features are processed
		* Rapidly
		* In parallel (Simultaneously)
		* Number of distractors makes little differences (pop-out)
* Conjunction Search
	* Conjunctions of features are processed (green T, orange O)
		* Slowly
		* Serially (One at a time)
		* Number of distractors does matter


* ![](./Visual_Search/pasted_image.png)
	* Why are results sloped upward for conjunction, but flat for feature trials?
		* Single feature search can be done in parallel, while conjunction searches must be done for each element serially
	* Why is slope twice as steep when target is absent compared to when it is present?
		* When target is present, search stops when target is found, whereas when target is absent, all elements must be searched



* **Binding Problem: **How perceptual features are bound together into coherent representations of objects
* **Illusory Conjunctions: **Briefly seeing a red 'O' in a sea of green Os and red Ts, despite no red O being present
