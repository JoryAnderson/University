### • Right and Left Parietal Lobes

* Damage to the right parietal lobe causes neglect of attention in the left side of the visual field, while damage to the left parietal lobe causes damage to both sides of the visual field.
* Lesions to the frontal cortex in areas associated with the parietal regions can also cause attention deficit.
	* Lesions on the frontal eye fields affect the opposite visual field, including difficulty initiating movement towards a target on that visual field, and directing attention to that side
* **Balint's Syndrome: **Caused by damage to the dorsal posterior parietal and lateral occipital cortex.
	* *simultanagnosia:	*The inability to process more than one visual object at a time
	* *optic ataxia:	*The impaired ability to reach for or point to an object in space under visual guidance
	* *oculomotor apraxia:	*Difficulty voluntarily directing eye gaze towars objects in the visual field with a saccade
* Lesions in the brainstem also stunt attention.
	* Lesions to the superior colliculus cause more lag in saccades.
		* Also slow the shifting of covert attention. More prominent in exogenous or novel stimuli.
