# Midterm Review
Created Wednesday 15 March 2017

### • Chapter 6 Summary:

* Early studies showed that humans experience difficulty focusing on multiple things at once, and when we do our performance deteriorates
* There are different ways that processing resources (related to **processing load**) are directed towards location and stimuli:
	* **Endogenous** attention is the ability to voluntarily direct attention according to one's goals, knowledge, or expectations.
	* **Exogenous** attention consists of attention triggered by particularily salient stimuli in the environment.
	* Both lead to enhanced processing of the location or stimuli.
* The effects of auditory and visual spatial attention on stimulus processing can begin at the early coritcal processing stages.
	* As early as 20ms in auditory attention and ~70ms for visual attention
* Attention can be directed towards nonspatial attributes of stimuli, including pitch, color, size, shape


### • Chapter 7 Summary:

* Paying attention elicits changes at many levels of the nervous system
* When certain areas in the parietal and frontal cortices are damaged, the ability to direct and allocate attention is compromised.
	* Suggests these areas are majorly involved in directing/allocating attention
* Studies have determined that the orienting of attention to locations or stimuli in the external environment is associated with actiity in several locations within the dorsal frontal and parietal cortices.
* Reorienting attention to salient or unexpected events (exogenous stimuli) triggers increased activity in the temporoparietal junction and the ventral frontal cortex.
* Visual Search:
	* Pop-out search:
		* Searching for a singly-characterized object in an array of objects.
	* Conjunction Search:
		* Searching for a doubly-characterized object in an array of objects.
* One popular model holds that in response to both endogenous and exogenous stimuli, the dorsal frontoparietal network, once activated, operates as the attentional orienting control system that sends a biasing signal to the relevant sensory cortices.
* A complimentary network of brain-regions, known collectively as "default-mode network" is anticorrelated in activcatoin pattern with the dorsal frontoparitetal control network.
	* Includes regions in the inferior midline frontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex.
