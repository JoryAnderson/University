# • Event Related Potentials

* Created Tuesday 21 February 2017



* **Electroencephalography (EEG)**
	* Non-invasive
	* Measures surface electric fields generated by Post-synaptic potentials in dendrites
	* High temporal resolution: signal sampled > 1000/sec
	* Low spatial resolution: up to 256 (2^8) electrodes

### • Event-Related Potentials (ERG)

* Averagr of EEG signals
* Time-locked to event of interest
* Usually plotted with negative up
