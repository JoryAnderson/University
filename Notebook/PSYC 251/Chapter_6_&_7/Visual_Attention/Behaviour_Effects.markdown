### • Posner's Spatial Cueing Paradigm

* Maintain central fixation
* Spatially cued trials
	* 80% valid
	* 20% invalid
* Neutral Trials
	* No spatial cue
* Source: Endogenous
* Target: External
* Covert
* Transient
* Selective

#### • With exogenous source:

* Short cue-to-target intervals (<= 100 ms)
	* Valid cue -> facilitation
* Long cue-to-target intervals (>= 300 ms)
	* Valid cue -> **Inhibitiion of Return (IoR)**
* Effects of endogenous and exogenus attention are different

	

#### • With objects

* Participants saw two side-by-sides rectangles
* A cue was then presented
* Followed by a target
* Participants indicated when they saw a target
* Cue could be:
	* Valid
	* invalid, on same object
	* Invalid, on different object
