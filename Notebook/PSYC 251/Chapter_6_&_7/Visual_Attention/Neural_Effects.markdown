• Effects of Attention
======================

* Attention affects reaction time to, accuracy about, and awarness of sensory stimuli
* Attention can have effects less than 100 ms after stimulus
* Attention modulates neural activity in brain areas corresponding to attended spatial location (left vs right) or feature (face vs scene)
* Attention enhances neural response to attended stimuli
