# • Neural Effects

* **Brainstem evoked responses **show the response from the stimuli in the brainstem/thalamus before being sent to the primary auditory cortex
* **Midlatency Responses **show the response from the stimuli in the auditory cortex before being sent to the secondary/tertiary auditory cortex
* **Late Waves **show the response from the stimuli in the secondary/tertiary cortex before the information is stored.


• Attentional Stream Paradigm
-----------------------------

* Random sequence of auditory bleeps
* Occasional deviant targets (different volume/pitch)
* Instructed to attend to one ear

	

* Had no effect on brainstem evoked potentials (unattended auditory neurons still fired)
* However, it had an effect on midlatency potentials
