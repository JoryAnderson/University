# â€¢ Ch.6 Key Terms

* Created Tuesday 07 March 2017



* **Arousal:	**describes the global state of the brain. Attentiveness and vigilant-ness.
* **Early Selection:	**A low level gating mechanism that can filter out irrelevant information before the completion of sensory/perceptual analysis.
* **Late Selection:	**A high-level gating mechanism that filters out irrelevant information after analysis has been completed or partially completed.
* **Endogenous Attention:	**Attention driven by one's knowledge, motivation, or expectations.
* **Exogenous Attention:	**Attention caused by salient stimuli in the local environment.
* **Inhibition of Return:	**A phenomenon observed in exogenous attention studies. The more time given to ready for an expected/unexpected salient stimuli, the less response time needed.
* **Brainstem Evoked Responses:	**Reflect activity evoked in the auditory brainstem nuclei as sound stimulus reaches the nuclei.
* **Attentional Stream Paradigm:	**A means for studying the mechanisms of auditory selective attention. Uses **auditory N1** to detect sound.
* **Auditory N1:	**A negative-polarity sensory wave occuring about 100 milliseconds after a sound.
* **Perceptual Load:	**The amount of processing resources needing to analyse current stimuli in the local environment.
	* Focusing on someone talking to you in a loud airport is a considerable amount of perceptual load
	* Focusing on a poppy in a quiet green field doesn't cause a lot of perceptual load.
* **Processing Negativity:	**A prolonged negative wave
* **Selection Negativity:	**Analogous to Processing Negativity
* **Visual Search:	**Analysing spatial information in visual fields in order to find something. (Looking for a friend with a green shirt will increase sensitivity to green field-wide)
* **Change Blindness:	**Changes in a picture of scene over time are not immediately apparent if not attended to.
