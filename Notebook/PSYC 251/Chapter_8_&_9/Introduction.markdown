### • Examples of Memory: Breakfast

* How my breakfast tasted this morning
* what I had for breakfast
* What i usually eat

**Memory:	**A series of processes whereby the nervous system aqcuires information from new experiences, retains this information, and uses it to guide behaviour and actions
**Learning: **	Closely associated with memory. Encapsulates **Encoding, Storage and Retrieval**
**Encoding:	**Memory traces altering the nervous system
**Storage:	**Retention of memory traces over time
**Retrieval:	**Accessing stored memory traces

### • Long Term Memory (LTM)

* Problem:
	* How to get information from experience, maintain over time, and use when relevant to guide behaviour
* Challenge:
	* Out of all experiences, what to remember, and how to retrieve when needed.

	

* Learning ~ Memory
* Memory involves multiple
	* Processes: encoding, storage, retrieval
	* Types: Semantic, episodic, procedural
	* Systems: hippocampus, cortex, amygdala
	* Tasks: free recall, stem completion, motor sequence, learning
* Memory requires physical change in nervous system
* Memory is **pervasive** in nervous system

	

* Strength of memory depends on number of & strength of synaptic connections between neurons



### • LTM Processes

* **Encoding:**
	* Initial creation of memory traces in brain from incoming information
* Consolidation:
	* Continued organization and stabilization of memory traces over time
* **Storage:**
	* Retention of memory traces over time
* **Retrieval:**
	* Accessing/using stored information from memory traces
* Possible Reconsolidation?
