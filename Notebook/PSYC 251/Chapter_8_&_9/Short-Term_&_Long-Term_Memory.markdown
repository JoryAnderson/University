### • Dissociating Short-Term and Long-Term

* **Short Term memory:**
	* Memory Span
	* Hear Three Words: "Time base offer"
	* Immediately recall in order: "Time base offer"
* **Long-Term Memory:**
	* List learning
	* Hear ten words: "hand cook laugh"
	* Immediately recall in any order: "cook, train, hand"
	* Repeat until all 10 recalled in any order.

	

* Temporoparietal Lobe handles Short-Term and Long-Term. Damage to the left side of the temporoparietal lobe affects Short-Term memory more than Long-Term.
	* Due to the possibility that Short-Term Memory task is harder than long-term
		* When system is partially damaged, short-term is affected more.
	* Or...
		* When the system is completely totalled, the brain can compensate for Long-Term but not Short-term

			

### • Single Dissociation

* A single dissociation does not necessarily demonstrate separable systems, different regions, or distinct cognitive processes
* A single dissociation might mean this, but to rule out alternative explanations 1 and 2 we need **Double Dissociation**

	

* Damage in bilateral medial temporal lobes leads to decreased performance in long-term memory, implying...



### • Double Dissociation

* This pattern cannot be explained by both explanations
	* Short-term cant be both easier and more difficult than long-term
* A double dissociation provides evidence for **separable systems** that depend on **different brain regions** and **distincvt cognitive processes**
* **Suggests that Short-Term and Long-term are separable systems**
