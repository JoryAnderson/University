# â€¢ Lab Notes

* Created Wednesday 08 March 2017



* Amygdala is lateral inferior to the fornix, superior rostral to the cerebellum
* The Entorhinal cortex is lateral ventral to the amydala
* The hippocampus is inferior to the amydala
* The parahippocampal cortex is inferior lateral to the corpus collasum, medial to the hippocampus
* The fornix is rostral superior to the cerebellum



* Recalling a list of similar items is considered episodic memory

* [../Priming/Types_of_Priming.txt](./Priming/Types_of_Priming.txt)



* Retrieval is under suspicion of being faulty in terms of priming/false memory
	* We can store memory perfectly, but each time it is retrieved, it is altered slightly.
	* Retrieving episodic memories is reconstructive, involving making a best hypothesis based on the evidence from memory plus prior experience
