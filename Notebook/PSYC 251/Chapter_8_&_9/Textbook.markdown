**Working Memory:	**Mediates maintenance and manipulation of information online for a few seconds or minutes, in contrast to Long-Term memory.
**Declarative Memory (Explicit):	**Refers to concious memory for events (episodic memory) and facts (semantic memory)
**Non-declarative Memory (Impicit):	**refers to memories that are expressed through performance independant of consciousness

#### Working Memory vs Declarative Memory:
**Amnesia:	**Severe memory loss due to brain damage 
**Anterograde Amnesia:** Memory loss after lesion
**Retrograde Amnesia:	**Memory loss before lesion
A person with amnesia, a condition affecting long-term memory, will not disrupt working (short term) memory.

#### Nondeclarative Memory
Nondeclarative memory is evidenced by changed behaviour
**Priming:	**A change in the processing of stimulus due to previous encounter with the same or related stimulus
**Skill-based learning:	**A gradual improvement in performance due to repetition.
