#### Priming Summary:
Change in stimulus processing due to prior exposure to same or related stimulus without concious awareness
Depends on region of cortex processing relevant representations
**Perceptual Priming:**
Sensory cortices (occipital lobe for vision, for example)
**Semantic/Conceptual Priming**
Unimodal & multimodal association cortices (e.g. anterior teporal, inferior parietal, prefrontal cortex)
