# • Implicit Memory

* Created Wednesday 08 March 2017


• Non-Associative Memory:
=========================

* A change in response to an unchanging stimulus



* ![](./Implicit_Memory/pasted_image.png)
	* **Habituation:**
		* **Reduced** response to an unchanging stimulus.
			* E.g: You stop noticing the busy traffic outside your new apartment after a while.
	* **Sensitization:**
		* **Increased **response to an unchanging stimulus
			* E.g: Rubbing your arms hurts more the longer you do it
	* Primarily involves sensory-motor reflex pathways

	

* The first evidence of neural basis of memory was observed in the sea slug *Aplysia*
* Touching a siphon -> withdrawal of gill (**Habituation**)
	* After repeated siphon stimulation -> Less withdrawal
		* The action potential was the same each time
		* The EPSP (Excitatory Post Synaptic Potential) decreased with each stimulation
		* Therefore the gill withdrawal decreased with each stimulation
* Shocking tail -> More Withdrawl (**Sensitization**)
	* Same action potential
	* Increased neurotransmitter release
	* Larger EPSP



#### • Short Term & Long Term Habituation vs. Sensitization

* **Short-Term changes:**
	* Lasts for minutes
	* Changes in amount of neurotransmitter released
	* (Short-Term Habituation/Sensitization ≠ short-term memory)
* **Long-Term changes:**
	* Lasts for hours, days, weeks
	* Changes in number of synapses
	* In **habituation**: leads to smaller amount of synapses on motor neuron axon
	* In **sensitization**: leads to increased amount of synapses on motor neuron axon (increased neurotransmitter release)



• Conditioning
==============

#### • Classical Conditioning:

* Pavlov noticed that a dog learned to salivate in reponse to a bell that predicted food.
* An initially neutral **conditioned stimulus** (CS) comes to elicit a **conditioned response** (CR) due to pairing with an appetitive or aversive **unconditioned stimulus **(US) which reflexively elicits an **unconditioned response** (UR)

#### • Trace vs Delay Conditioning:

* **Eyeblink Conditioning**
	* US = air puff
	* UR = eye blink
	* CS = tone
	* CR = eye blink
* **Delay conditioning**
	* Cerebellum
* **Trace conditioning**
	* Cerebellum + hippocampus
	* Requires memory trace to link CS to US



#### • Fear conditioning

* US = shock
* UR = freezing
* CS = tone
* CR = freezing
* EPSP to tone increases in lateral nucleas of amygdala after repeating pairing with shock



• Skill Learning
================

* ![](./Implicit_Memory/pasted_image003.png)
* **Motor skill learning**
	* Motor adaptation
		* Cerebellar loops
	* Motor sequence learning
		* Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops
* **Cognitive Skill learning:**
	* Problem-solving
		* Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops
* **Perceptual Skill Learning:**
	* Identification and categorization
		* cortex



#### • Motor Adaptation

* **Motor perturbation task**
	* Depends on spatial representations in parietal lobe
* ![](./Implicit_Memory/pasted_image004.png)
* **Throwing darts with prism glasses**
	* Eye-hand coordination
	* Prism glasses shift visual field to side
	* Control participants adapt to distortion
	* Patients w/ cerebellar lesions fail to adapt
* **Recap: Cerebellum**
	* Uses forward model to predict results of motor commands
	* Uses differences b/w actual results and predicted results for
		* Motor learning
		* Online error correction
	* Feedback control
* ![](./Implicit_Memory/pasted_image005.png)


#### • Motor Sequence Learning:

* Depends on basal ganglia & **reinforcement learning**
	* Select action expected to lead to maximum reward
	* Perform action
	* Compare actual reward to expected reward
		* Prediction error = actual reward - predicted reward
	* Use prediction error to update expectations
	* Repeat
* Dopamine signal from substatia nigra pars compacta represents prediction erro
	* Larger response = better than expected
	* Smaller response = worse than expected
* **Reinforcement Learning:**
	* Unexpected rewards generate dopamine signals from substantia nigra pars compacta
	* This excites direct pathway and inhibits indirect pathway
	* Allows modification of behaviour based on reward


#### • Cognitive Skill Learning

* Weather predi
