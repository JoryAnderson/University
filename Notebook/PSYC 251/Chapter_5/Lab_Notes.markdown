Created Wednesday 08 March 2017

Matching each component with the best description of its role in motor control:
**Primary Motor Cortex: **
Cortical source of movement signals sent to brainstem and spinal cord
**Cerebellum:**
Coordination, error correction, and learning of fine movement skills 
**Supplementary Motor Cortex: **
Production of internally generated sequences of movement
**Superior Colliculus: **
Control of eye movements
**Basal Ganglia: **
Initiation and Inhibition of movements and reward-based learning
**Premotor Cortex:**
Motor planning and awareness of motor intentions
**The premotor cortex is rostral to the primary motor cortex**

**The cerebellum is posterior and inferior to the basal ganglia**

#### Fitt's Law:
Even though the formula states the same distance and size of target will yield an identical result, movement times are volatile, and the probability of identical time is very unlikely.
	
The time to move to a target increases as the distance gets longer
the time to move to a target decreases as the width gets bigger
Relationship between distance/width to time elapsed is proportional.
10cm away, 2cm wide target and 30cm away, 6cm target should yield the same time.
