# Midterm Review
Created Wednesday 15 March 2017

â€¢ Summary:
----------

* Motor Control is hierarchial:
	* Upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex and cortical premotor areas issue motor commands that activate local circuits and low motor neuron pools to achieve more specific behaviour goals
	* Lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem are the final common pathway for motor commands that determine behaviours arising from skeletal muscle movement, therefore effectors of cognitive processes.
* Descending pathways from the motor and premotor cortices are important in planning and initiating voluntary, goal-driven sequenes of movement, especially for learned motor skills. These circuits are also sensitive to motivational goals
* The motor and premotor cortices are under the modulatory influence of the basal ganglia and cerebellum.
	* The basal ganglia controls initiation and stopping of movemen, selection of movement that satisfy behavioural goals.
	* Cerebellum coordinates movements by correcting unanticpiated errors on ongoing motor processsing
* Damage to any motor control circuit results ikn specific disruptions in motor planning, initiation and coordination. Damage to the basal ganglia or cerebellum cause deficits in other cognitive processes as well.



* **Apraxia:**
	* The loss of ability to execute learned movements / actions.
	* Linked to damage in the parietal and premotor cortices.
