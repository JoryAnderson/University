# â€¢ Motor Rep. & Motor Cortex & Super Collic.

* Created Monday 20 February 2017


### Motor Representation

* Motor cortex represents a directional movements of body parts, not specific muscle actions
* Early studies conducted show that stimulation of the **primary motor cortex** in the precentral gyrus evokes contralateral muscle contractions (contraction on opposite side of body)
* Shows a similar sensory system to somatosensory system.
	* The amount of cortical space given to each part of the body determines the amount of finer motor control allowed by each limb.
* Signals from motor cortex travel directly to lower motor neurons and lower circuit neurons in brainstem and spinal cord

* Scientists researching monkeys wondered if the primate brain's neuron activity specifies what to do (a motor command) or how to do it
	* Early studies of this showed that stimulation of these neurons evoke multijoint movements. That is, stimulation may cause a monkey to outreach its hand with fingers stretched, or bringing its hand to its mouth (eating)
		* This conclusion is supported by the fact descending projections (from upper level neurons) mainly control local circuits in the brainstem and cord, rather than the low level neurons themselves


### Superior Colliculus
The local circuits in the brainstem controlling eye movements is under direct control of neurons in the **superior colliculus**
The neurons in the cortical map of eye movement average out which neurons in the map fired and forms a direction to look using the average.
