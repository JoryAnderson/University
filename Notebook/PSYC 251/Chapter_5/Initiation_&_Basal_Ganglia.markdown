# • Initiation & Basal Ganglia

* Created Monday 20 February 2017


### • Basal Ganglia

* Help to select, initiate, and inhibit movements through coritco-basal gangloa-thalamocortical loops
* Critical to dopamine-based reinforcement learning (learning when to act from reward)
* Participate in motor control, cognitive control, and emotional control
* Summary: Serves as a gating mechanism, inhibiting potential movements until they are fully appropriate for the circumstances in which they are to be executed
* Animals with lesions in the basal ganglia (specifically the caudate and and putamen) can perform learned actions but cannot perform or learn new actions to acquire rewards or avoid punishment


### • Direct Pathway

* Cortex
* Striatum
* Globus Pallidus pars interna (GPI) / Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR)
	* **Parkinson's Disease: **The selective death of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata that use dopamine. Disruption in the ability to perform movement
	* **Huntington's Disease: **The selective activation of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata that use dopamine. Creates involuntary dancelike(choreiform) movements.
* Thalamus
* Cortex


### • Indirect Pathway

* Cortex
* Striatum
* Globus pallidus pars externa (GPE)
* Subthalamic Nucleus
* Globus pallidus pars interna (GPI) / Substantia nigra pars rreticulata "(SNR)
* Thalamus
* Cortex

### • Baseline Activation

* GPI and SNR have high tonic activity,  inhibiting thalamus


### • Action Initiation

* **Direct Pathway:**
	* Motor cortex excites striatum
	* Striatum inhibits GPI / SNR
	* Thalamus excites cortex
* This aids selection and initiation of an action
* **Indirect Pathway:**
	* Motor cortex excites striatum
	* Striatum inhibits GPE
	* GPE disinhibits STN
	* STN excites GPI/SNR
	* GPI/SNR reinhibit thalamus
* This acts as a closing gate, inhibiting additional actions
* more steps in indirect pathway make it slower to act than direct pathway


### • Reinforcement Learning

* Unexpected rewards generate dopamine signals from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC)
* This excites the direct pathway (via D1 receptors) and inhibits direct pathway (via D2)
* Allows modding of behaviour based on reward
