### • Cytoarchitecture of Cerebellum

* Cerebellar Cortex
	* Highly regular arrangement
* Granule cells
	* ~50 billion (3/4 of all neurons in brain)
* Purkinje cells
	* ~200,000 inputs per cell


### • Cerebellum

* Sits atop the pons at the top of the brainstem.
* Responsible for error correction necessary to produce smoothly coordinated, skilled movements
* Uses **forward model** to predict results of motor commands
	* Current position and motor commands
		* Predicts resulting position
* uses differences between actual results and predicted results for:
	* "online"(on-the-fly) error correction
	* Motor learning
* **Feedback control**


### Coordination

* Damage to the parietal cortex can disrupt both reaching and saccades - known clinically as **optic ataxia**
	* Implies that the parietal cortex assists in hand-eye coordination
	* Dorsal visual system important for guiding movement
	* Summary: important to the integration of visual, eye position, and limb-position data


#### • Feedback Control

* Feedback takes time
* The faster you go, the less time you have for feedback
* Less feedback leads to greater error
* Fitt's law describes the speed/accuracy tradeoff for pointing motions
