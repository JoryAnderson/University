* Created Monday 20 February 2017


### • Cortex to Spinal Cord

* Axons from primary motor cortex synapse directly o nlower motor neurons and local circuit neurons
* However, spinal cord circuits can also control movements on their own



### • Central Pattern Generators

* Local circuits in spinal cord
	* Can control complex movements
	* Can respond to environmental changes
	* Do not require high-level input
