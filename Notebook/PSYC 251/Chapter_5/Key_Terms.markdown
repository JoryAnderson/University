**Motor Programs:**
Sets of commands to initiate a sequence movements
**Lower Motor Neurons:**
Motor neurons residing in the brainstem and spinal cord
**Local Circuit Neurons:**
At the lowest level, there are circuits in the brainstem and spinal cord consisting of lower motor neurons and local circuit neurons. Local Circuit Neurons provide sensory input to lower motor neurons, therefore providing local coordination to perform sets of movements (walking, swimming)
**Upper Motor Neurons:**
Reside in the cerebral cortex and brainstem. Provide descending control of local circuitry in the brainstem and spinal cord
**Primary Motor Cortex:**
Motherboard of motor function. Involved in the planning, initiating, and directing of motor movements.
**Premotor Cortical Areas:**
Includes the **Premotor Cortex** and the **Supplementary Motor Cortex.** Both assist in planning motor movements, guiding intended movement, and selecting an action based on the desired goal.
**Medullary Pyramid:**
An area of the spinal cord that the axons of upper motor neurons pass through in order to reach local circuits and lower motor neurons
**Frontal Eye Fields:**
Areas of the eye's visual fields.
**Superior Colliculus:**
Controls the neurons in the brain stem coordinating eye movements, easily accessible.
**Saccades:**
Patterns of eye movement. Our eyes dont smoothly read a page in a book, they jump from the end of a line to a new one, and from word to word. **Saccade Trace**
**Readiness Potential:**
Related to intention. Readiness Potential rises when movement is planned, and falls when the planned movement is executed
**Anosognosia:**
"Loss of awareness". Patients with this condition suffer from damage in their premotor areas as well as the primary motor cortex. Patients cannot acknowledge their inability to move, or even deny it.
**Reward Value:**
The percieved value of the reward by the patient or volunteer
**Supplementary Motor Area (SMA):**
Crucial to generating movements in absense of external ques.
**Optic Ataxia:**
Disrupts reaching and saccades, failure to correctly integrate eye/hand movement to target.
**Basal Ganglia:**
Helps to select, initiate, and inhibit unappropriate movements. Critical to reward-based learning. Participates in motor, cognitive, and emotional control
**Gating:**
Inhibiting or Selecting things
**Caudate & Putamen:**
Components of the basal ganglia (known collectively as the **Striatum**)
**Global Pallidius**
Another component of the Basal Ganglia
**Substantia Nigra Pars Reticulata (SNR):**
A piece of the motor pathway (both direct/indirect)
**Parkinson's Disease:**
Selectively destroys neurons in the basal ganglia, leading to inability to execute movement
**Huntington's Disease:**
Selectively targets neurons in the basal ganglia and stimulates them, leading to involuntary dancelike (choreiform) movements
**Choreiform:**
Dancelike
**Hemiballismus:**
Similar to Huntington's Disease.
**Cerebellum:**
Located on top of the pons (on the brainstem), assists in Error Correction, coordiation,
**Intention Tremor:**
Abnormal movements when intent is present (movement is janky and weird)
