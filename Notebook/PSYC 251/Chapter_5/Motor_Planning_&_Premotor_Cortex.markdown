# • Motor Planning & Premotor Areas

* Created Monday 20 February 2017



* Planning of voluntary actions begins at a conceptual level based on goals resides in premotor areas
	* Quench thirst
		* Drink from cup
			* Pick up cup with hand
				* Activate appropriate muscle in arm
* Premotor Cortex:
	* Involved in selecting goals and planning actions at a conceptual level
	* Particularly when plans are driven by external stimuli.
	* Planning occursd before voluntary movement
* Therefore, Primary Motor Cortex is hierarchally organized while the premotor areas provide abstract plamnning information, which is translated into the intention to perform specific movements in the motor cortex.


### Planning an intended action
Scientists ask human to perform a voluntary movement, moving their finger at any time of their choosing. Scalp recordings show negative wave around 2 seconds before the action.
Called **readiness potential**, begins bilateraly in premotor areas, but later becomes enhanced over motor cortex contralateral to the finger movement.
Damage to the premotor areas can cause **agnosognosia**, "loss of awareness", where patients are unaware of their immobility
	
### Well-learned responses and Sensory ques
The **supplemenatary motor areas (SMA)** are crucial to performing well-learned movement without sensory cues.
The **premotor cortex** is crucial to performing cued movements
Damage to the SMA causes monkeys to not be able to perform well-learned movements and rely solely on external cues
Damage to the premotor cortex causes the inverse: Monkeys can perform wel-learned movements without cues but cannot perform visually guided movements
	
**Muscimol: **A GABA agonist.
When monkeys are injected with Muscimol, monkeys were unable to perform actions from memory. Which proposes that the SMA neurons convey information needed to guide the production of a sequence of reaching movements.
	


### • Planning for Multiple Alternative Actions

* Task: Reach for target w/ arm
* Spatial cues:
	* Monkey is cued with two possible targets (red/blue)
* Memory Period:
	* Cues are removed, monkey seems to prepare for both actions
* Color cue
	* Monkey is cued with actual target, and now prepares single action
* Go signal
	* Monkey does

### • Mirror Neurons

* Some neurons in premotor cortex represent actions at a conceptual level
* Performing or observing actions results in neurons (mirror neurons) firing.
* Ex:
	* Breaking a peanut
	* Watching / hearing someone else break a peanut
	* Watching 
	* Hearing
