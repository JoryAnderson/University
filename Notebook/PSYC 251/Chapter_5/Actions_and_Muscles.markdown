# â€¢ Actions and Muscles

* Created Monday 20 February 2017



* Lower motor neurons synapse directly on muscle fibers
* Release of neurotransmitter causes muscle fibers to contract
* Muscle spindles detect changes in muscle length and send them back to spinal cord via dorsal root ganglia
* For limbs with finer motor control, each motor neuron innervates fewer muscle fibers
