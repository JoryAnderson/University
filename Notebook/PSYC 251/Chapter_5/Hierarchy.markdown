# â€¢ Hierarchy

* **Motor Programs:**
	* Sets of commands to initiate a sequence of movements.
* **Primary Motor Cortex:**
	* In contrast to the premotor areas, the primary motor cortex does not require a lot of current to evoke movements (electrical stimulation)
	* The axons of upper motor neurons that reside in the Primary Motor Cortex that (for example) control facial movements branch off at appropriate levels, while those continuing to the spinal cord  coalesce and descend through the medullary pyramids in the pyramidial tract
* Neural circuits controlling skeletal movements can be broken up into 4 subdivisions:
	* **Cerebellum:**
		* Assists with sensory-motor coordination
	* **Basal Ganglia:**
		* Gating proper initiation of movement
	* **Upper motor neurons:**
		* Motor neurons in the brainstem / cortex.
		* Allow for descending control of circuitry in the brainstem and spinal cord (circuits that control low motor neurons)
			* Descending control of this sort originates from the upper motor neurons within the **primary motor cortex** and the adjacent **premotor cortical areas** (which include the **premotor cortex** and **supplementary motor cortex)**
		* **Motor Cortex:**
			* Planning, initiating, and directing voluntary movement
		* **Brainstem Centers:**
			* Basic movements and postural control
	* **Low motor neurons:**
		* Motor neurons located in spinal cord and brainstem
		* Exist within the grey matter of the spinal cord and brainstem
		* Send axons out of the CNS to muscle fibers on the skeleton.
		* AP fire immediately after contraction of muscles
			* Correlation with movement of relevant body part



* At the lowest level are circuits within the brainstem and spinal cord, which are composed of low motor neurons and **local circuit neurons**. local circuit neurons provide sensory input to the low motor neurons, allowing for local coordination of low motor neurons (walking, chewing, etc)



* Local circuits exist such that can produce complicated movement without brain input. Ex: Locomotion, swimming
