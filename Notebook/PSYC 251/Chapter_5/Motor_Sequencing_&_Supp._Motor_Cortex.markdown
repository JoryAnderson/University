# • Motor Sequencing & Supp. Motor Cortex

* Created Monday 20 February 2017



* Supplementary Motor Cortex (SMA)
	* Involved in selecting goals and planning actions at a conceptual level
	* Particularly when plans involve internally generated sequences of action
		* Tying shoelaces
		* Playing a song on a piano / instrument
		* Performing a dance sequence
		* Pitching a baseball



### • Learned Vs. Cued Sequences

* Behavioural performance with SMA deactivated by muscimol injection (GABA agonist)
	* Circle = cue for specific action
	* Square = cue for learning action
	* Triangle = action
	* Blue = right
	* Red = wrong
