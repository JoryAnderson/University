# Union, Intersect, and Diff
Created Thursday 21 September 2017

We can apply union, intersection, difference- on relations R and S provided that:
R - S (R MINUS S)
R U S (R UNION S)
R [/\](file:////) S (R INTERSECT S)
Before using union, intersect, or difference, both tables must have the same kind and amount of tuples.
