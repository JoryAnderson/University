# MEGATRON 747 Disk Params
Created Thursday 02 November 2017

There are 8 platters providing 16 surfaces
There are 2^16, or 65,536 tracks per surface
On average, there are 2^8 = 256 sectors per track
There are 2^12 = 40096 = 4K bytes per sector.
Therefore, the capacity = 16*(2^16)*(2^8)*(2^12) = 2^40 = 1TB
