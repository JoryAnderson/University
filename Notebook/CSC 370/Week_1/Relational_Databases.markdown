# Relational Databases
Created Thursday 07 September 2017


* A database system should present the user witrh a view of data organized as tables (also called relations)
* Behind the scene there couuld be complex data structures and algorithms that allow rapid response to a variety of queries
	* But the user would not be concerned with these things
* Queries could be expressed in a very high level language, which greatly inc reases the efficiency of DB programmers
	* This high level language for relational databases is called Structured Query Language (SQL)



#### SQL

* SQL was initially developed at IBM in the early 70s
* This version, was initially called SEQUEL (Structured english query language)
* Was later changed to SQL due to a copyright complaint
