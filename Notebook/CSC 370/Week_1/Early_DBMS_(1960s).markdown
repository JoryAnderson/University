# Early DBMS (1960s)
Created Thursday 07 September 2017


* Encourage the user to **view the data** much as it was **stored**
* Chief models were the *Hierarchical* and *Network* models
* Main characteristic: **easy jumping** or **navigating** from one object to anothet through pointers
* However these models **didn't provide a high-level query language** for the data.
	* So, one had still to wirte programs for querying the data
* Also they didn't allow online schema modifications
