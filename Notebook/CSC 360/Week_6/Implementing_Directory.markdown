Directory Table
Linear list or hash table
Linear list:
Simple, yet expensive due to linear searches, 
Hash table
Cheap accesses, deletes, and inserts.
Collisions possible, the worst downside being if the number of files grows too large, a new hash function must be created and thus the rest of the file system needs to be reorganized according to the new hash function
directory entry
e.g., UNIX (i-node, name)
