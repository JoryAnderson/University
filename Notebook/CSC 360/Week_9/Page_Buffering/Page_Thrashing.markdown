# Page Thrashing
Created Friday 23 March 2018

Thrashing
More time on paging than executing
busy I/O, idle CPU
more processes admitted, more page faults
more processes in thrashing!

Why Thrashing
paging: explore locality
thrashing: locality explored too much!
	
### Paging and Thrashing
Why does thrashing occur?
Sum of size of locality > total memory size
