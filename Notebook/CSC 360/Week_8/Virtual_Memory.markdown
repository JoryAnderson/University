# Virtual Memory
Created Friday 23 March 2018

Load an entire process into physical memory?
not all addresses accessed at the same time
some even not used before swapped out
	
Virtual memory
logical space >> physical space
only load the portion being used or to be used
more (partial) processes in physical memory
faster swap in/out
