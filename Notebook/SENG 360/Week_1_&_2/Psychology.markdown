### Pretexting
Pretexting is the act of creating and using an invented
scenario (the pretext) to engage a targeted victim in a manner
that increases the chance the victim will divulge information
or perform actions that would be unlikely in ordinary
circumstances. It is more than a simple lie, as it most often
involves some prior research or setup and the use of priori
information for impersonation (e.g., date of birth, Social
Security Number, last bill amount) to establish legitimacy in
the mind of the target.[3]

### Social Psychology

1. Only 29% of subjects resist a bogus majority
2. 60% of subjects will do things if told by authority
