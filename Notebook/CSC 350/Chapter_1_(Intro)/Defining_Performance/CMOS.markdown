Complementary metal oxide semiconductor
Sometimes also **complementary-symmetry** metal oxide semiconductor
Has been the dominant technology for frabrication of Integrated Circuits (ICs) since the early 1970s
Energy is consumed when transistors switch state
From 0 to 1, and vice versa
This is also called dynamic energy
The bit value is, in reality, a bit of charge stored by the capactivie properties of a transistor
What is that capacitive load?
What voltage corresponds to 1?

**Energy** for one transition (0 to 1, 1 to 0) can be modeled as:
__Energy = 1/2 * Capacitive Load * (Voltage__^2^__)__
which also can be represented as:
__E = 1/2 * C * V__^2^ 
Actual **power **consumed depends upon the number of transitions per unit time
__Power = 1/2(Capacitive Load) * (Voltage)__^2^__* Frequency Switched__
or
__P = 1/2 * C * V__^2^__ * F__
	
We cannot keep reducing voltages forever
To lower the voltage, the more leaky the transistor becomes
This is a quantum phenomenon
There is research into new materials in an attempt to reduce leakage
Strained silicon (modifying normal silicon interatom distance in the substrate)
High-kappa dielectrics (material that separates the transistor gate from the silicon substrate)
However, this is proving to be not enough to keep Moore's Law in effect
We are in the midst of a major chance in the way processors are designed and fabricated
