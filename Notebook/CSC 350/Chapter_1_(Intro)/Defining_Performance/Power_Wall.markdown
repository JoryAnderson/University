The problem is not necessarily power:
Practically it constrains what we can effecticely cool
Warehouse-scale server farms with tens of thousands of servers are concerned with cooling
The problem now is one of **energy**
Many processors are in devices powered by batteries
Battery life can trump performance for personal devices
Ex: Much cleverness contained in Android to minimize energy and memory usage
Designers are noe beginning to focus more power on energy consuption (joules) rather than just power (joules [/](file:///) second)
