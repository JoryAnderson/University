Other Laws
==========

Dennard Scaling (Robert H. Dennard):
------------------------------------

* As transistors get smaller...
	* ...their power density stays constant, so that power use stays in proportion with area
	* Broken down in 2006 due to 'current leakage'. Is a bigger problem when things get smaller

	

Koomey's Law (Jonathan Koomey)
------------------------------

* The number of computations per joule of energy doubles ever 2.6 years
* The number of years has changed (i.e., doubling used to be faster - 1.57 years - a couple of decades ago)
