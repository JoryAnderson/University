# Abstraction
Created Monday 07 January 2019


* This term is used constant in computer science
	* ...but its essential meaning is that some specific set of details are important for problem solving from some particular perspective
	* while others (i.e., lower-level details) are specifically hidden from that perspective
* Abstraction helps us to problem-solve without drowning in a sea of details
	* A challenge, therefore, is to be at least aware of what kind of low-level details are being hidden to us, without knowing the details themselves

	

* **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**
	* e.g., Intel x86, ARM, Atmel AVR
	* This becomes the interface between the software (written in the ISA) and hardware (actual transistors performing operations)



* **Application Binary Interface (ABI)**
	* Combination of both the ISA plus the system software interface
	* For example, dictates the purpose meant for certain machine registers
