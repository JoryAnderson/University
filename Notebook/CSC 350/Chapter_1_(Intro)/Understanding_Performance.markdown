# Understanding Performance
Created Monday 07 January 2019

**Algorithm**

* Determines the number of problem-solving steps ("operations") executed

**Programming language, compiler, instruction set architecture**

* Determines the number of machine instructions executed per algorithm operation

**Processor and memory system design**

* Determines how fast machine instructions are executed

**I/O System (including OS)**

* Determines how fast problem data can be brought into (and sent out of) the computer


### System Layers
**Application Software**

* Normally written in a high-level language (HLL)

**System Software**

* Compiler: translates HLL code into machine code
* Operation System: Service code for handling I/O, managing memory and storage, scheduling tasks and sharing resources

**Hardware**

* Processor(s), memory, I/O controllers


### Recall: Levels of Program code
**HLL:**

* Level of abstracvtion closer to problem domain (i.e., narrow semantic gap from solution in the domain to solution in code)
* Provides for productivity and portability

**Assembly Language**

* Textual representation of machine instructions
* Much more lower level, yet the best coupling to an architectures possibilities

**Hardware representation / machine code**

* Binary digits (bits)
* An encoding of instructions, data, perhaps control
