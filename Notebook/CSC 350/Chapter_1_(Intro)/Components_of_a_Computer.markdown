# Components of a Computer
Created Monday 07 January 2019


* With respect to performance/design, interested in 5 components:
	* Input
	* Output
	* Memory
	* Datapath
	* Control
* Often the last two are simply called a processor, but we are splitting for this course

### Inside the processor

* Datapath
	* Hardware that performs operations on data
	* adders, bit shifters, etc
* Control
	* Sequences actions on datapath
	* Determines what in memory is used to feed the datapath
* Memory
	* Here we mean the SRAM (i.e., cache memory) used for immediate access to data
