# Chapter 2 (Instructions)
Created Monday 14 January 2019

### Recall:

* ISA is a fundemantal abstraction for a computer system
	* The details **visible** ar those of the instructions (the "what")
	* The details hidden include the way those instructions are realised in silicon (the "how")
* The same ISA may have very, very different implementations
	* In fact, the ISA itself can be emulated / simulated
* Note: We have to be clear on the level of abstraction upon which we focus
	* The ISA strictly does not include details about instruction-class CPI
	* Yet we may want to pay attention to CPI when considering performance/design
