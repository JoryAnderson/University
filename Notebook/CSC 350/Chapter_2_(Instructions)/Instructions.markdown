# Instructions
Created Monday 14 January 2019


* Another view: Instruction sets is the repertoire of operations / instructions of a computer
* Different computers may have different instruction sets
	* Yet even different sets have many aspects in common
* Early computers had very simple instructions set
	* Hardware implementations were necessarily simple
	* Computations were primarily numerical (either scientific or financial)
* Instruction sets started to become much more complex in the mid 1950s
* However, many current modern computers have simple instruction sets
	* What happened?

### MIPS instruction set

* Large share of embedded core market
	* Applications in consumer electronics, netrwork/storage equipment, cameras, printers, etc.
* Use of MIPS not nearly as widespread as ARM
	* But in many respects it is a cleaner, simpler design
	* It is something of an underdog in today's market
* Typical of many modern ISAs
	* Textbook includes a green reference data chart
	* Also available at: <https://tiny.cc/rume2y>


### ARM & MIPS: Comparison

* ARM: The most popular embedded core
* Similar basic set of instruction to MIPS
