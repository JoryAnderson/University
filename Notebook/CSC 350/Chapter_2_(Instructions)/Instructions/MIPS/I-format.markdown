Immediate arithmetic and load/store instructions
rt: destinatoin register
rs: base address
if offset, effective address is rs + offset
if constant, value ranges from -2^15^ to +2^15^-1 (16 bits max)
	
**Design Principle 4: Good Design Demands Good Comprimises**
Different format complicate code
but allow 32-bit instructions uniformly
Keep formats as similar as possible
