# Flash Storage
Created Monday 11 March 2019

Nonvolatile semiconductor storage
100x-1000x faster than disk
Smaller, lower power, more robust
But more $/GB (b/w disk and DRAM)


### Flash Types
**NOR flash: **Bit cells like a NOR gate
Random read/write access
Used for instruction memory in embedded systems
**NAND Flash**: bit cells like a NAND gate
Denser (bits/area), but block-at-a-time access
Cheaper per GB
Used for USB keys, media storage
Flash bits wears out after 1000's of accesses
Not suitable for direct RAM or disk replacement
**Wear leveling:** remap data to less used blocks
