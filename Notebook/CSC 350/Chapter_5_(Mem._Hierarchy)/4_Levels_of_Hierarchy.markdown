Created Monday 11 March 2019

Static RAM (SRAM)
Access time: 0.5ns to 2.5ns; $2000 to $5000 per GB
Dynamic Ram (DRAM)
Access time: 50ns to 70ns; $10 to $50 per GB
Flash Ram (SSD)
Access time: 10 microseconds to 100 microseconds depending on tech, whether read or write; $1 to $4 per GB
Magnetic Disk
Access time: 5ms to 20ms; $0.10GB to $2 per GB
	
**Ideal Memory**
**Would have access time of SRAM**
**Would have capacity and cost/GB of disk**
