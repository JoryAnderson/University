# Building a Datapath
Created Monday 04 February 2019

**Datapath:**
**Elements** that **process data and addresses** in the CPU
Consists of **registers, ALUs**, **multiplexers**~, ~**memories** (and more)
The dataoath for our simplified MIPS ISA will **be built incrementally** in lectures
In essence, we will refine the design further and further as we add needed functionality and deal with complications in design
