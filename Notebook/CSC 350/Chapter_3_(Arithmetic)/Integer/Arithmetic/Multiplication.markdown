# Multiplication
Created Monday 28 January 2019

Observation:
The operations as we learned in grade school are simply algorithms, including multiplication
These algorithms lend themselves to paper & pencil approaches
However, we are clearly not restricted to these methods of arithmetic
"Wild and crazy"
Some of the approaches used to perform computer multiplication may seem very complex...but they are all in the service of having as mnuch of the operation performed in parallel as possible
Lastly:
Multiplication assumed to be less frequent than addition
	
### Long Multiplication
1010~10~ * 1001~10~ = 1011010~10~
Similarly, this is the same for base 2, and any other base
