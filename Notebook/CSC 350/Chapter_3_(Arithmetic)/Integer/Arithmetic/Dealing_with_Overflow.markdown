# Dealing with Overflow
Created Monday 28 January 2019

Some languages (e.g., C) ignore overflow
use MIPS addu, addui, subu instructions
Other languages (e.g., Ada, FORTRAN) require the raising of an exception
Use MIPS add, addi, sub instructions
On detection of an overflow from a MIPs instruction, invoke exception handler in language
