# Arithmetic for multimedia
Created Monday 28 January 2019

Graphics and media processing operate on vectors of 8-bit and 16-bit data
These use 64-bit adders
**Carry chain ** is partitioned
Operates on 8x8-bit, 4x16-bit, or 2x32-bit vectors
**SIMD **(Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data) parallelism
**Saturating** operations
On overflow, result is largest representable value
Used in 2s-complement module arithmetic
Exam[ples: clipping in audio, saturation in video
