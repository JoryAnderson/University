# Chapter 5 (Mem. Hierarchy)
Created Monday 11 March 2019

### the problem of memory
The **relative difference in speeds** between fastest and slowest memory continues to increase
We can build faster and faster CPUs
but **if** **we cannot feed them with data at a fast enough rate**
then all efforts by designers to decrease CPI are for naught
**If money and space is no object** then we can build very large, very fast memories
Not practical
Computers will continue to be a mix of small/fast/expensive memory with large/slow/cheaper memory.
