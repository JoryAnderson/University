# Introduction
Created Monday 07 January 2019

### Main Course Themes:

* How languages are **translated** into **machine language**
	* how they are **executed**
* The idea of the **hardware/software interface**
* How computer architects ("Hardware Designers") **improve performance**
* What is **parallel processing**?
	* and why it is the future of computing...**or is it?**
* Instruction sets and processor architecture
* Memory hierarchy desugb
* instruction-level parallelism
* thread-level parallelism
* representative architectures, especially RISC architecture
* Multiprocessors and parallel machines
* GPUs


### Extra topics (if time permits)

* Domain-specific architectures (perhaps even bowing to trendiness by looking at TPUs)
* Open-source architectures (e.g., MIPS Open RISC-V)
* Overview of quantum computing
