* Python may be flexible when assigning variables to data elements
	* but python is not casual about types, it enforces the types of objects, similar to java.
	* x=2, y = this number is:
	* print(y + x) will complain
	* print(y + str(x)) will work
* Calling a function is similar to java, C
* Functions without a return actually do return the special value **None**
	* None is a special constant in the language
	* None is used like NULL, void, or nil in other languages
	* None is also equivalent to False
	* The interpreter doesnt print None
* Functions can be:
	* Arguments to functions
	* Return values of functions
	* Assigned to variables
	* parts of tuples, list, etc
	* ...
