# Tuples Vs. Lists
Created Friday 14 October 2016


* Lists are slower at runtime, but are more flexibile than tupels.
	* Lists can be modified, and they have lots of handy operations we can perform on them.
	* tuples are immutable and have fewer features, but have faster runtimes.
* However, we can convert between the to, if we realize we need to make a change to a tuple, or make a list immutable.
	* li = list(tu)		changes tu into a list named li
	* tu = tuple(li)		changes li into a tuple named tu.
