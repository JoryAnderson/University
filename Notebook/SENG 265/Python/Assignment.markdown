* Binding a variable in pythons mean ssetting a name to hold a reference to some object
	* Assignment creates references, not copies
* Names in Python dont have a type. Objects have types.
	* PYthon determines the type based on the data assigned to it
* Garbage collection in Python is extreme. once out of scope the ref is gone.



* You can also do multiple assignment
	* x, y = 2, 3
	* x = 2
	* y = 3



* Names are case sensitive and cannot start with a number.
	* Reserved words:
