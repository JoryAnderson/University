# Using Git in General
Created Thursday 22 September 2016

**Using Git**

* **You need a git client**
	* We use a command-line client
	* Other clients:
		* Some IDES have built-in git functionality
		* Built into tool
		* Some web interfaces for using git (especially needed for Git-Hub)
* **For uVic SENG265, you need a repo**
* **Need access to that repo**
* UVic Software Engineering hosts a repo for you
	* This is a per-course basis
	* <ssh://jba@git.seng.uvic.ca/seng265/jba>
* other possibilities:
	* github-like services
	* BitKeeper
	* admining your own server

**A small word**

* For this course, use the seng265 repo
	* NOT GITHUB
* Each of your asignments and labs..
	* .. Will be subdirectories within your repo
	* ...Which are accessible to the lab instructors and admins for help when debugging
	* and can be remotely accessed by you
