**Properties of Directories** 

* Directories are actually ordinary files 
* Information contained in a directory file simply has a special format 
* Every directory contains two special directory entries 
* ~ is used to denote a home directory 
	* cd /home/user ≈      cd ~user 
	* cd /home/user ≈       cd ~user  
	* Depends on your flavour of Ubuntu 
* "cd" = change directory 
* "ls" can be considered as "list", where it will list all files/directories in the selected location. 
* "open" \directory\stuff.avi will open stuff.avi wherever you are.
