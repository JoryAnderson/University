# Tokenizing
Created Wednesday 05 October 2016


* Common problem to be solved:
	* An input line consists of individual words
	* Words are separated by whitespace
	* Want to get a list of the individual words
* this is called tokenizatoin
	* From the word token used by compiler writers
* Once streams of tokens are extracted from text, compiler operates on tokens, not text
* We ourselves can use tokenzie functionality available in the C runtime library
