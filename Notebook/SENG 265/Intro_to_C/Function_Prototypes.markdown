Created Thursday 06 October 2016


* A **function declaration** provides a prototype for a function
* Such a declaration includeS: optional storage class, function return type, function name, and function parameters
* A function definition is the implementation of a function; includeS: function declaration and the function body. Definitions are allocated storage
* A function's declaration should be "Seen" by the computer before used
	* Why? **Type checking**
* ANSI compliant C compilers may refuse to compile your source code if you use a function for which you have not provided a declaration. The compiler will indicate the name of the declared function
