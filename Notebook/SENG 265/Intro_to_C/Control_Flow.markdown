# Control Flow
Created Thursday 29 September 2016


* five basic flow control statements
	* if-then, if-then-else (conditional)
	* switch (multi-branch conditional)
	* while (iteration, top tested)
	* do while (iteration, bottom-tested)
	* for (iteration)
* Other control flow constructs (WONT BE USED)
	* "goto", there are many reasons to use this, SO WE WONT. (thank fuck)
		* use "continue/break" instead.
	* "setjmp/longjmp",  special functions provided by the stdlib to implement non-local return from a function - wont be used
* C does not have a boolean type
	* But we can do conditional expressions (similar to java)
	* Any expression that evaluates to 0 is false, otherwise true.
* The assignment operator ("=") and equality operator ("==") have different meanings
