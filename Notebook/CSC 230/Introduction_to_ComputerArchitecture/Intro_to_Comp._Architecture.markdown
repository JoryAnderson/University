### • Basic Processor Architecture

* Computer AKA Stored program processor
* Every computer's processor executes the principle of a "fetch-decode-execute" cycle.
	* Instruction is fetched from program memory
	* It is decoded,
	* then exected
* This cycle is driven by a clock (pulsed timing signals)

* All computers work depend on a timing signal or clock
* **clock:** a periodic timing signal whose period is called a cycle
* Each processor operates at certain frequency aka processor speed.
* 1000 cycles/sexond = 10^3 Hz = 1KHz
* 1,000,000 cycles/second = 10^6 Hz = 1 Mega Hertz = 1Mhz(million)
* 1,000,000,000 cycles/second = 10^9Hz = 1Giga Hertz = 1GHz
* Every processor has its own native language, called **Machine Language**

* A bit is a single binary digit
* A byte is a collection of 8 bits.
* A word is the maximum amount of bits a CPU will allow. A 16-bit CPU will use words of 16-bits long.
